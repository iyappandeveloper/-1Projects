However, questions like whether the methylation marks themselves are faithfully transmitted into daughter cells and through what mechanisms are currently under active investigation. Previously, methylation was considered to be irreversible, but the recent discovery of histone lysine demethylases revealed a dynamic nature of histone methylation regulation on four of the main sites of methylation on histone H3 and H4 tails (H3K4, H3K9, H3K27 and H3K36). Even so, it is still unclear whether demethylases specific for the remaining two sites, H3K79 and H4K20, exist. Furthermore, besides histone proteins, the lysine methylation and demethylation also occur on non-histone proteins, which are probably subjected to similar regulation as histones.

Beyond their shared abilities to stabilize and condense chromatin, the H1 variants have been found to have non-redundant functions, the mechanisms of which are not fully understood. Like core histones, there are both replication-dependent and replication-independent linker histone variants. The histone chaperones and other factors that regulate linker histone dynamics in the cell are largely unknown. In particular, it is not known whether replication-dependent and replication-independent linker histones interact with distinct or common sets of proteins. To better understand linker histone dynamics and assembly, we used chromatography and mass spectrometry approaches to identify proteins that are associated with replication-dependent and replication-independent H1 variants. We then used a variety of in vivo analyses to validate the functional relevance of identified interactions.<h3>Results</h3>We identified proteins that bind to all linker histone variants and proteins that are specific for only one class of variant. The factors identified include histone chaperones, transcriptional regulators, RNA binding proteins and ribosomal proteins. The nuclear pore complex protein Tpr, which was found to associate with only replication-dependent linker histones, specifically promoted their stability.ConclusionReplication-dependent and replication-independent linker histone variants can interact with both common and distinct sets of proteins. Some of these factors are likely to function as histone chaperones while others may suggest novel links between linker histones and RNA metabolism. The nuclear pore complex protein Tpr specifically interacts with histone H1.1 and H1.2 but not H1x and can regulate the stability of these replication-dependent linker histones.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12858-016-0074-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."],"author_name":["Branson OE","Michael A Freitas","Parthun MR","Mark R.

Now, in this issue of PNAS, Shiio and Eisenman (5) report that sumoylation is yet another histone modification, and, interestingly, it may regulate transcriptional repression. Although there may appear to be a bewildering array of histone modifications involved with gene regulation, there could be a fairly simple paradigm underlying them. Eukaryotic DNA is packaged within the nucleus through its association with histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), forming the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, the nucleosome. The precise architecture of chromatin dictates whether it is permissive or resistant to transcription and other DNA-templated processes, such as replication, DNA repair, and recombination. Hence, it is not surprising that mechanisms that promote changes in chromatin structure are central to transcriptional regulation. One key pathway to alter chromatin structure involves covalent modifications of the histone tails. Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) shares 18% identity with ubiquitin and adopts a similar 3D structure (6). Ubiquitylation has a role in protein degradation, whereas SUMO does not. The size of SUMO and ubiquitin (11 and 9 kDa, respectively) clearly distinguishes them from the other known posttranslation modifications of histones, which are all small chemical groups. SUMO and its ATP-dependent pathway of conjugation to substrates are con served in all eukaryotes investigated, yeast through humans. One important consideration regarding sumoylation of histones is that its target residue, lysine, is a putative substrate for multiple modifying enzymes (Table 1). Acetylation of lysines is dynamically opposed by deacetylating enzymes. Typically, histone acetylation is activating and histone deacetylation is repressing, and, in a symmetrical fashion, DNA-bound activators and repressors recruit these enzymes to target genes (1). By contrast, lysine methylation on histones appears to be quite stable (no demethylases …"],"author_name":["D Nathan","David E. Sterner","Dafna Nathan","D. E. STERNER ","S L Berger","Shelley L.

Our study suggests that cadmium increases global H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 by inhibiting the activities of histone demethylases, and aberrant histone methylation that occurs early (48 h) and at 4 weeks is associated with cadmium-induced transformation of BEAS-2B cells at the early stage."],"author_name":["Yujie Xia","Tu W","Liu Y"," Zhou X","Wei Tu"," Costa M","Chunlian Xiao ","Max Costa","Yin Liu","Xia Y","Chengfeng Xie","Xie C","Xiao C ","Xue Zhou"],"author_slug":["yujie-xia/2766009","tu-w/12648011","liu-y/13964","zhou-x/8420975","wei-tu/654814","costa-m/8427567","chunlian-xiao/27564455","max-costa/86302","yin-liu/160969","xia-y/5242","chengfeng-xie/6668228","xie-c/9107364","xiao-c/8801075","xue-zhou/151072"],"citation_count":[18],"doi":["10.1093/toxsci/kfv019"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfv019"],"id":[22028884],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology"],"keywords":["cadmium, carcinogenesis, epigenetics, histone demethylase, histone methylation"],"pub_date":["2015-02-13"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Journal article"],"slug":["22028884-cadmium-induces-histone-h3-lysine-methylation-by-inhibiting-histone-demethylase-activity"],"title":["Cadmium induces histone H3 lysine methylation by inhibiting histone demethylase activity."]},"id":4485771},{"score":30.177725,"doc":{"abstract":["Ethanol increases histone H3 acetylation in the rat liver. However, the effect of other carbon chain length alcohols, consumed as surrogate alcohols and used in industry, on H3 acetylation is unknown. Hence, we investigated the effect of these alcohols on histone H3 acetylation, cell toxicity and HAT and HDAC activity.Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were incubated with selected concentration (40 mM) of different chain length alcohols with or without inhibitors of alcohol metabolizing enzymes. Cells were also treated with low concentration (2.5 mM) of 1-propanol or 1-butanol or isopentanol, with or without 40 mM ethanol for 24 hours. Effects of the metabolites of these alcohols were also studied. Cytotoxicity was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and mitochondrial activity (MTT assay). The degree of histone H3 acetylation at specific lysine residues were monitored by western bloting using site specific antibodies. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and colorimetric assay respectively.Alcohols with increasing carbon chain length exhibited a variable effect on the ratio of acetylated lys9 histone H3 to beta-actin. A graded increase (methanol < ethanol < 1-propanol < 1-butanol) followed by a gradual decrease (1-butanol > 1-pentanol > 1-hexanol > 1-octanol) in the ratio was observed. Other lysine sites were not affected. HAT activation also corresponded to the acetylation profile. These alcohols or their metabolites did not significantly alter HDAC activity in the hepatocytes. Low concentration (2.5 mM) of 1-propanol alone did not affect acetylation, but sensitized the ethanol induced H3 acetylation at lysine 9 (H3AcK9). 1-Butanol and isopentanol also increased the response of ethanol induced H3AcK9. Alcohol metabolizing inhibitors attenuated ethanol and propanol induced increase in H3AcK9. Carboxylic acid metabolites of these alcohols also increased HAT activity and histone H3 acetylation at lysine 9. Propionate and butyrate modestly inhibited HDAC activity in an in vitro assay.Surrogate alcohols modulate H3AcK9 via increasing HAT activity and this is dependent on their metabolism.

Each nucleosome contains 147 letters of DNA code and two copies of four different histones – H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 – meaning eight proteins in total.The two copies of each histone protein found in a nucleosome are referred to as “sister” histones and are identical. Histone proteins have long tails that the cell can edit by adding chemical groups at specific positions. This changes the way the cell copies, uses and repairs its DNA. Previous studies show that identical sister histones can end up with different modifications. But, it was not clear what effect this had.To adress this issue, there are two questions to answer. What do asymmetric sister histones do in living cells? And, does a modification to one histone affect its sister? Gene editing could help scientists to understand the effect of asymmetrical tail modification by forcing cells to make non-identical sister histones. However, this is challenging because most animals studied in the laboratory have many copies of the genes for histones. Fruit flies, for example, have 23 copies of their histone genes. The single-celled yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only two copies of its histone genes. Yet, even if one of these genes was replaced with a mutant gene and the other left unedited or “wild-type”, there would be nothing to stop the cell from forming nucleosomes in which both sister histones were still identical – that is to say, mutant with mutant or wild-type with wild-type.Now, Zhou, Liu et al. report a new method that allowed them to edit the tail sequence of one H3 histone but not its sister. First, they searched for, and found, a pair of mutant H3 genes, which encode two extremely similar but different H3 proteins that could bind to each other but not to themselves. As a result, yeast cells with the genes for these proteins could only form nucleosomes in which the sister H3 histones were non-identical. Next, Zhou et al. made a small change to the tail of one of the H3 sisters which meant it could not be modified. The resulting nucleosomes contain one H3 histone with a wild-type tail and one with a mutant tail. The cell could only modify one of them, mimicking natural asymmetrical modifications.The new technique revealed that modification of one sister does not affect the the other. It also revealed that modifications to sister histones can work both alone and together. In some cases, the cell needs only edit one tail to affect the use of a gene. Other times, it must edit both tails for greatest effect.This new tool is the first step in understanding the contribution of the tails of sister histones in living cells. In future, it should help to uncover the effect of different combinations of modifications. This could shed light on how cells control the use of different genes."],"author_name":["Li Ma","Ling-li Zhang","Ma L.","Gong T"," Cai C","Chen Cai","Li HT","Jin-Qiu Zhou","Yu-Ting Liu","Hu YN","Hong-Tao Li","Liu YT","Ting Gong","Ya’nan Hu","Zhou JQ","Zhang LL","Zhen Zhou","Wei G","Zhou Z","Gang Wei"],"author_slug":["li-ma/53164","ling-li-zhang/1197474","ma-l/8606787","gong-t/11776821","cai-c/8437034","chen-cai/1776421","li-ht/10999821","jin-qiu-zhou/99840","yu-ting-liu/1227653","hu-yn/11923502","hong-tao-li/1343628","liu-yt/11186871","ting-gong/531303","ya-nan-hu/3362235","zhou-jq/11964992","zhang-ll/11122279","zhen-zhou/258806","wei-g/8980848","zhou-z/13207","gang-wei/333403"],"citation_count":[1],"doi":["10.7554/eLife.30178"],"html_url":[""],"id":[6021461],"impact_factor":["8.519"],"impact_factor_int":[8],"journal":["eLife"],"keywords":["sister histones,histone H3 methylation,histone crosstalks,chromatin,transcription"],"pub_date":["2017-10-13"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Research article"],"slug":["6021461-independent-manipulation-of-histone-h3-modifications-in-individual-nucleosomes-reveals-the-contributions-of-sister-histones-to-transcription"],"title":["Independent manipulation of histone H3 modifications in individual nucleosomes reveals the contributions of sister histones to transcription"]},"id":558877},{"score":29.81289,"doc":{"abstract":["Histone modifications are increasingly being used as biomarkers of cancer prognosis and survival.

Histone modifications, such as reversible acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination, which collectively contribute to the establishment of distinct chromatin states, play important roles in the recruitment of repair factors to the sites of double-strand breaks. Here we report that histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1), a classical B type histone acetyltransferase responsible for acetylating the N-terminal tail of newly synthesized histone H4 in the cytoplasm, is a key regulator of DNA repair by homologous recombination in the nucleus. We found that HAT1 is required for the incorporation of H4K5/K12-acetylated H3.3 at sites of double-strand breaks through its HIRA-dependent histone turnover activity. Incorporated histones with specific chemical modifications facilitate subsequent recruitment of RAD51, a key repair factor in mammalian cells, to promote efficient homologous recombination. Significantly, depletion of HAT1 sensitized cells to DNA damage compromised the global chromatin structure, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced cell apoptosis. Our experiments uncovered a role for HAT1 in DNA repair in higher eukaryotic organisms and provide a mechanistic insight into the regulation of histone dynamics by HAT1.

Histone methylation is a tightly controlled mechanism that is responsible for both activating as well as repressing gene expression in a site-specific manner, depending on which lysine residue is methylated. Histone methyltransferases, including MLL1, DOT1L, EZH2, and SETD2 are recurrently deregulated in human leukemia, either directly by gene mutations or balanced translocations, or indirectly as components of protein complexes that are disturbed in leukemia due to alterations of the other components in these complexes. Several small molecule inhibitors of histone methyltransferases are currently being clinically evaluated for their therapeutic potential in human leukemia. These drugs reverse some of the adverse effects of aberrant histone methylation, and can induce differentiation and cell death in leukemic blasts."],"author_name":["Chopra M","Bohlander SK"],"author_slug":["chopra-m/8733532","bohlander-sk/11205222"],"citation_count":[9],"doi":["10.1016/j.cancergen.2014.10.005"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cancergen.2014.10.005"],"id":[21712540],"impact_factor":["2.333"],"impact_factor_int":[2],"journal":["Cancer genetics"],"keywords":["Cancer, epigenetics, histone methylation, histone methyltransferases, leukemia"],"pub_date":["2015-01-17"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Journal article"],"slug":["21712540-disturbing-the-histone-code-in-leukemia-translocations-and-mutations-affecting-histone-methyl-transferases"],"title":["Disturbing the histone code in leukemia: translocations and mutations affecting histone methyl transferases."]},"id":3940849},{"score":29.520199,"doc":{"abstract":["Recently, Pérez-Montero and colleagues (Developmental cell, 26: 578-590, 2013) described the occurrence of a new histone H1 variant (dBigH1) in Drosophila. The presence of unusual acidic amino acid patches at the N-terminal end of dBigH1 is in contrast to the arginine patches that exist at the N- and C-terminal domains of other histone H1-related proteins found in the sperm of some organisms. This departure from the strictly lysine-rich composition of the somatic histone H1 raises a question about the true definition of its protein members. Their minimal essential requirements appear to be the presence of a lysine- and alanine-rich, intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain, with a highly helicogenic potential upon binding to the linker DNA regions of chromatin. In metazoans, specific targeting of these regions is further achieved by a linker histone fold domain (LHFD), distinctively different from the characteristic core histone fold domain (CHFD) of the nucleosome core histones.

It is well established that citrullination of histones (e.g., CitH3) facilitates chromatin decondensation during NET formation (NETosis), particularly during calcium-induced NETosis that is independent of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) activation. However, the importance of other forms of histone modifications in NETosis has not been established. We considered that acetylation of histones would also facilitate NETosis. To test this hypothesis, we induced NOX-dependent NETosis in human neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate or lipopolysaccharide (from Escherichia coli 0128), and NOX-independent NETosis with calcium ionophores A23187 or ionomycin (from Streptomyces conglobatus) in the presence or absence of two pan histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), belinostat and panobinostat (within their half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) range). The presence of these inhibitors increased histone acetylation (e.g., AcH4) in neutrophils. Histone acetylation was sufficient to cause a significant increase (~20%) in NETosis in resting neutrophils above baseline values. When acetylation was promoted during NOX-dependent or -independent NETosis, the degree of NETosis additively increased (~15–30%). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is essential for baseline NETosis (mediated either by NOX or mitochondria); however, HDACis did not promote ROS production. The chromatin decondensation step requires promoter melting and transcriptional firing in both types of NETosis; consistent with this point, suppression of transcription prevented the NETosis induced by the acetylation of histones. Collectively, this study establishes that histone acetylation (e.g., AcH4) promotes NETosis at baseline, and when induced by both NOX-dependent or -independent pathway agonists, in human neutrophils. Therefore, we propose that acetylation of histone is a key component of NETosis."],"author_name":["Meraj A Khan","Nades Palaniyar","Hussein J.

The H1 component was responsible for this inhibition, no effect being exerted by the other histones. H1 preparations were more effective if renatured in the presence of EDTA — 90% inhibition being reached at a 0.3:1 (w/w)H1/DNA ratio. It seems likely that the requirement for the presence of EDTA during the renaturation process is correlated to its ability to induce a fairly stable ordered conformation of the histones, although this effect could also be shown with the ‘inactive’ H2a, H2b and H3 components, and was instead less evident with histone H1.

The present review focused on the most recent advances, described the key function sites of histone lysine methyltransferases, integrated significant quantities of data to introduce several compelling histone lysine methyltransferases in various types of human cancers, summarized their role in tumor development and discussed their potential mechanisms of action."],"author_name":[" Li J","Ke XX","Hongjuan Cui","Shunqin Zhu","Zhu S","Xiao-Xue Ke","Jifu Li","Cui H."],"author_slug":["li-j/8393580","ke-xx/14365418","hongjuan-cui/1063163","shunqin-zhu/1568655","zhu-s/10756","xiao-xue-ke/1999544","jifu-li/1774778","cui-h/9159753"],"citation_count":[1],"doi":["10.3892/br.2016.574"],"html_url":["http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4774316"],"id":[1221392],"impact_factor":[""],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Biomedical Reports"],"keywords":["histone lysine methyltransferases,histone methylation,tumor development"],"pub_date":["2016-01-21"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Research article"],"slug":["1221392-role-of-several-histone-lysine-methyltransferases-in-tumor-development"],"title":["Role of several histone lysine methyltransferases in tumor development"]},"id":478948},{"score":28.873268,"doc":{"abstract":["A genome-wide histone hyperacetylation is known to occur in the absence of transcription in haploid male germ cells, spermatids, before and during the global histone eviction and their replacement by non-histone DNA-packaging proteins.

The acetylation of histone H3 lysine (H3K9Ac), histone H3 lysine 18 (H3K18Ac), and histone H4 lysine 12 (H4K12Ac), and the dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9diMe) and histone H4 arginine 3 (H4R3diMe) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 237 ESCCs. The K-means clustering algorithm was used to identify unique patterns of histone modifications. At a median follow-up of 5.1 years, 109 (46%) of 237 patients had developed recurrence of disease. Mean global levels of H3K9Ac, H3K18Ac, H3K9diMe, H4K12Ac, and H4R3diMe were 81.5%, 65.1%, 80.3%, 45.9%, and 27.4%, respectively. In the analysis of individual histones, a 1% increase in the global level of H3K18Ac in pathologic stage III worsened RFS at 1.009 times [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.001-1.016; P = 0.03], after adjusting for age, sex, and operative method. Cluster analysis also showed significant effects of histone modifications on RFS. For stage IIB cancers, Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that RFS of cluster 1, with high global levels of H3K18Ac and H4R3diMe, was 2.79 times poorer (95% CI, 1.14-6.27; P = 0.008) than that of cluster 2, with low levels. RFS for stage III cancers was also poorer in cluster 1 than cluster 2 (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.10-5.34; P = 0.02).

We describe histone mutations that suppress some of these defects, providing new insight into the mechanism of FACT activity in vivo. FACT is primarily known for its ability to promote reorganization of nucleosomes into a more open form, but neither the pob3-Q308K mutation nor the compensating histone mutations affect this activity. Instead, purified mutant FACT complexes fail to release from nucleosomes efficiently, and the histone mutations correct this flaw. We confirm that pob3-T252E also suppresses pob3-Q308K and show that combining two suppressor mutations can be detrimental, further demonstrating the importance of balance between association and dissociation for efficient FACT:nucleosome interactions. To explain our results, we propose that histone H4 can adopt multiple conformations, most of which are incompatible with nucleosome assembly. FACT guides H4 to adopt appropriate conformations, and this activity can be enhanced or diminished by mutations in Pob3 or histones. FACT can therefore destabilize nucleosomes by favoring the reorganized state, but it can also promote assembly by tethering histones and DNA together and maintaining them in conformations that promote canonical nucleosome formation.

Phylogenetic analysis of identified members of H2A and H2B histones suggested rapid expansion of these groups in Hydrozoa resulting in the appearance of unique subtypes. Amino acid sequence level comparisons of H2A and H2B forms with bilaterian counterparts suggest the possibility of a highly mobile nature of nucleosomes in hydra.

Aberrant histone methylation caused by alteration in chromatin-modifying enzymes has long been implicated in cancers. More recently, recurrent histone mutations have been identified in multiple cancers and have been shown to impede histone methylation. All three histone mutations (H3K27M, H3K36M, and H3G34V/R) identified result in amino acid substitution at/near a lysine residue that is a target of methylation. In the cases of H3K27M and H3K36M, found in pediatric DIPG (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma) and chondroblastoma respectively, expression of the mutant histone leads to global reduction of histone methylation at the respective lysine residue.

Protein methylation is involved in many important biological processes, and most recent studies focused on lysine methylation of histones due to its critical roles in regulating transcriptional repression and activation. Histones possess highly conserved sequences and are homologous in most species. However, there is much less sequence conservation among non-histone proteins. Therefore, mechanisms for identifying lysine-methylated sites may greatly differ between histones and non-histone proteins. Nevertheless, this point of view was not considered in previous studies. Here we constructed two support vector machine (SVM) models by using lysine-methylated data from histones and non-histone proteins for predictions of lysine-methylated sites. Numerous features, such as the amino acid composition (AAC) and accessible surface area (ASA), were used in the SVM models, and the predictive performance was evaluated using five-fold cross-validations. For histones, the predictive sensitivity was 85.62% and specificity was 80.32%. For non-histone proteins, the predictive sensitivity was 69.1% and specificity was 88.72%. Results showed that our model significantly improved the predictive accuracy of histones compared to previous approaches. In addition, features of the flanking region of lysine-methylated sites on histones and non-histone proteins were also characterized and are discussed. A gene ontology functional analysis of lysine-methylated proteins and correlations of lysine-methylated sites with other PTMs in histones were also analyzed in detail.

Nucleosomes are stable enough to organize the genome yet must be dynamically displaced and reassembled to allow access to the underlying DNA for transcription, replication, and DNA damage repair. Histone chaperones are a non-catalytic group of proteins that are central to the processes of nucleosome assembly and disassembly and thus the fluidity of the ever-changing chromatin landscape. Histone chaperones are responsible for binding the highly basic histone proteins, shielding them from non-specific interactions, facilitating their deposition onto DNA, and aiding in their eviction from DNA. Although most histone chaperones perform these common functions, recent structural studies of many different histone chaperones reveal that there are few commonalities in their folds. Importantly, sequence-based predictions show that histone chaperones are highly enriched in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and acidic stretches.

Histones are refolded and reconstituted into soluble octamer by dialysis against 2M NaCl, and metal-affinity purified through an N-terminal polyhistidine-tag added on the H2A. After cleavage of the polyhistidine-tag, histone octamer is further purified by size exclusion chromatography. We show that the nucleosomes reconstituted using the purified histone octamer above are fully functional. They serve as effective substrates for the histone methyltransferases DOT1L and MLL1. Small angle X-ray scattering further confirms that the reconstituted nucleosomes have correct structural integration of histone octamer and DNA as observed in the X-ray crystal structure. Our new protocol enables rapid reconstitution of histone octamer with an optimal yield. We expect this simplified approach to facilitate research using recombinant nucleosomes in vitro.

Histone acetylation is a major modification that affects gene transcription and is controlled by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HATs acetylate lysines of histone proteins, resulting in the relaxation of chromatin structure, and they also facilitate gene activation. Conversely, HDACs remove acetyl groups from hyperacetylated histones and suppress general gene transcription. In addition to histones, numerous nonhistone proteins can be acetylated and deacetylated, and they also are involved in the regulation of a wide range of diseases. To date there are 18 HDACs in mammals classified into 4 classes based on homology to yeast HDACs. Accumulating evidence has revealed that HDACs play crucial roles in a variety of biological processes including inflammation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis. In this review we summarize the current state of knowledge of HDACs in carcinogenesis and describe the involvement of HDACs in cancer-associated molecular processes.

The capability of chromium to cause cancers has been known for more than a century, and numerous epidemiological studies have been performed to determine its carcinogenicity. In the post-genome era, cancer has been found to relate to epigenetic mutations. However, very few researches have focused on hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI))-induced epigenetic alterations. The present study was designed to investigate whether Cr(VI) would affect the level of a newfound epigenetic modification: histone biotinylation. Histone acetylation and histone biotinylation were studied in detail using human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells as an in vitro model after Cr(VI) treatment. Our study showed that Cr(VI) treatment decreased histone acetylation level in 16HBE cells. In addition, low doses of Cr(VI) (≤0.6μM) elevated the level of histone biotinylation. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of biotinidase (BTD), a major protein which maintains homeostasis of histone biotinylation, showed that the distribution of BTD became less even and more concentrated at the nuclear periphery in cells exposed to Cr(VI). Moreover, Cr(VI)-induced histone deacetylation may take part in the regulation of histone biotinylation. Together, our study provides new insight into the mechanisms of Cr(VI)-induced epigenetic regulation that may contribute to the chemoprevention of Cr(VI)-induced cancers and may have important implications for epigenetic therapy.

There is increasing evidence that epigenetic modifications may become compromised in aging and increase susceptibility to the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Immunohistochemical labelling of free-floating sections from the inferior temporal gyrus (Alzheimer's disease, n=14; control, n=17) and paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays containing tissue from the middle temporal gyrus (Alzheimer's disease, n=29; control, n=28) demonstrated that acetyl histone H3 and acetyl histone H4 levels, as well as total histone H3 and total histone H4 protein levels, were significantly increased in post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brain tissue compared to age- and sex-matched neurologically normal control brain tissue. Changes in acetyl histone levels were proportional to changes in total histone levels. The increase in acetyl histone H3 and H4 was observed in Neuronal N immunopositive pyramidal neurons in Alzheimer's disease brain. Using immunolabelling, histone markers correlated significantly with the level of glial fibrillary acidic protein and HLA-DP, -DQ and -DR immunopositive cells and with the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (hyperphosphorylated tau load and β-amyloid plaques). Given that histone acetylation changes were correlated with changes in total histone protein, it was important to evaluate if protein degradation pathways may be compromised in Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, significant positive correlations were also found between ubiquitin load and histone modifications. The relationship between histone acetylation and ubiquitin levels was further investigated in an in vitro model of SK-N-SH cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor Mg132 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid. In this model, compromised protein degradation caused by Mg132 lead to elevated histone labelling. In addition, valproic acid worked synergistically with Mg132 in elevating ubiquitin load and causing cell death. These findings highlight important pathological relationships linking a compromise in protein turnover with the histone changes observed in Alzheimer's disease post-mortem human brain.

Expression diversity of these nucleoproteins has greatly influenced the chromatin structure and gene expression regulation in dinoflagellates. Histone replacement proteins (HLPs and DVNPs) are hypothesized to perform a few similar roles as histone proteins do in other eukaryotes, i.e., gene expression regulation and repairing DNA. However, their role in bulk packaging of DNA is not significant as low amounts of proteins are associated with the gigantic genome.

Epigenetics that ensure the somatic inheritance of differentiated state is defined as a crucial factor influencing malignant phenotype without altering genotype. Histone modification is one such alteration playing an essential role in tumor formation, progression, and resistance to treatment. Notably, changes in histone acetylation have been strongly linked to gene expression, cell cycle, and carcinogenesis. The balance of two types of enzyme, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), determines the stage of histone acetylation and then the architecture of chromatin. Changes in chromatin structure result in transcriptional dysregulation of genes that are involved in cell-cycle progression, differentiation, apoptosis, and so on. Recently, HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) are identified as novel agents to keep this balance, leading to numerous researches on it for more effective strategies against cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM). This review elaborated influences on gene expression and tumorigenesis by acetylation and the antitumor mechanism of HDACis.

Chromatin structures are maintained through assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes catalyzed by histone chaperones. Asf1 (anti-silencing function 1) is a highly conserved histone chaperone that mediates histone transfer on/off DNA and promotes histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation at globular core domain of histone H3. To elucidate the role of Asf1 in the modulation of chromatin structure, we screened and identified small molecules that inhibit Asf1 and H3K56 acetylation without affecting other histone modifications. These pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione derivative molecules inhibited the nucleosome assembly mediated by Asf1 in vitro, and reduced the H3K56 acetylation in HeLa cells. Furthermore, production of HSV viral particles was reduced by these compounds. As Asf1 is implicated in genome integrity, cell proliferation, and cancer, current Asf1 inhibitor molecules may offer an opportunity for the therapeutic development for treatment of diseases.

Our analyses of these mice revealed that Phf2 has a positive role in adipogenesis by coactivating CEBPA, one of the master regulators of adipogenesis, through its demethylation activity toward H3K9me2. In this commentary, we discuss several remaining questions that underlie phenotypic abnormalities seen in our investigations of Phf2 knockout mice.

Alterations of histone charges by “small” chemical modifications (e.g., acetylation, phosphorylation) could regulate nucleosome spontaneous dynamics without globally affecting nucleosome structure. These fluctuations in nucleosome wrapping can be exploited by chromatin‐processing machinery. In contrast, ubiquitin and SUMO are comparable in size to histones, and it seems logical that these PTMs could conflict with canonical nucleosome organization.

We show that post-translational modifications (PTMs) are transmitted with parental histones to newly replicated DNA. Di- and trimethylation marks are diluted twofold upon DNA replication, as a consequence of new histone deposition. Importantly, within one cell cycle, all PTMs are restored. In general, new histones are modified to mirror the parental histones.

The present study aimed to clarify whether histones can activate neutrophils to induce NET formation and whether rTM can prevent histone-induced NET formation. NET formation was analyzed in vitro by stimulating human neutrophils with histones in the absence or presence of rTM. NET formation was further analyzed in vivo by intravenous infusion of histones into rats with or without rTM. Histones induced NET release in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and NET release was induced as early as 1 h after stimulation. Histone-induced NET release was independent of NADPH oxidase. rTM suppressed histone-induced NET release in vitro as well as in vivo. The suppression might be mediated by rTM binding to histones, as suggested by analysis using a quartz crystal microbalance system. The present findings suggest that histones can activate neutrophils to form NETs and that rTM can inhibit histone-induced NET formation."],"author_name":["Takashi Ito","Mika Yamamoto"," Takaaki Totoki","Midori Kakuuchi ","Tomoka Nagasato","Binita Shrestha","Ikuro Maruyama"],"author_slug":["takashi-ito/102878","mika-yamamoto/1338494","takaaki-totoki/10587732","midori-kakuuchi/19879445","tomoka-nagasato/1613086","binita-shrestha/1613087","ikuro-maruyama/294004"],"citation_count":[0],"doi":["10.3389/fimmu.2019.02535"],"html_url":["https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02535/full"],"id":[23648469],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Frontiers in immunology."],"keywords":["histone, NETs, thrombomodulin, thrombosis, neutrophil"],"pub_date":["2019-10-10"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["article"],"slug":["23648469-recombinant-thrombomodulin-suppresses-histone-induced-neutrophil-extracellular-trap-formation"],"title":["Recombinant Thrombomodulin Suppresses Histone-Induced Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation"]},"id":3864133},{"score":27.370495,"doc":{"abstract":["Stored, soluble histones in eggs are essential for early development, in particular during the maternally controlled early cell cycles in the absence of transcription.

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has only one histone H2A variant (H2AV), which is a chimera of H2AZ and H2AX. In this study we found that lack of H2AV led to the formation of black melanotic masses in Drosophila third instar larvae. The formation of these masses was found in conjunction with a loss of the majority of the primary lymph gland lobes. Interestingly, the cells of the posterior signaling center were preserved in these mutants. Reduction of H2AV levels by RNAi knockdown caused a milder phenotype that preserved the lymph gland structure but that included precocious differentiation of the prohemocytes located within the medullary zone and the secondary lobes of the lymph gland.

The evidence that As induces both loss of global DNA methylation and gene promoter DNA hypermethylation has suggested that epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in As-induced carcinogenesis. In the present study, we examined the change in histone methylation by As exposure. In human lung carcinoma A549 cells, exposure to inorganic trivalent As (arsenite) increased H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and decreased H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), both of which represent gene silencing marks, while increasing the global levels of the H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), a gene-activating mark. The increase in H3K9me2 was mediated by an increase in the histone methyltransferase G9a protein and messenger RNA levels. We also observed strikingly significant altered histone modifications induced by very low-dose (0.1 microM) arsenite. Taken together, these results suggest a potential mechanism by which As induces carcinogenesis through the alteration of specific histone methylations that represent both gene silencing and activating marks. Furthermore, these marks are known to affect DNA methylation, and it is likely that arsenic's effect is not limited to histone modifications alone, but extends, perhaps by them, to DNA methylations as well. Future studies in our laboratory will address the genomic location of these silencing and activating marks using ChIP-on-chip technology."],"author_name":["Thomas P Ellen","T. P.

We find that depletion of JMJD1B increases the protein levels of the histone chaperone tNASP leading to an accumulation of newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 at early steps of the histone maturation cascade, which perturbs chromatin assembly. Furthermore, we find a high rate of JMJD1B mutations in cancer patients, and a correlation with genomic instability.

The histone acetyltransferase (HAT) regulator of Ty1 transposition 109 (Rtt109) is the sole enzyme responsible for H3K56ac in yeast. Much research has centered on this particular histone modification and histone-modifying enzyme. This Critical Review summarizes much of our current understanding of nucleosome assembly and highlights many important insights learned from studying Rtt109 HATs in fungi. We highlight some seminal features in nucleosome assembly conserved in mammalian systems and describe some of the lingering questions in the field. Further studying fungal and mammalian chromatin assembly may have important public health implications, including deeper understandings of human cancers and aging as well as the pursuit of novel anti-fungal therapies.

Because cnidarian genomes are conventional in terms of protein-coding genes, their remarkable features are likely a consequence of epigenetic regulation. To facilitate epigenetics research in cnidarians, we analysed the histone complement of the cnidarian model organism Hydractinia echinata using phylogenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and mRNA in situ hybridisations. We find that the Hydractinia genome encodes 19 histones and analyse their spatial expression patterns, genomic loci and replication-dependency. Alongside core and other replication-independent histone variants, we find several histone replication-dependent variants, including a rare replication-dependent H3.3, a female germ cell-specific H2A.X and an unusual set of five H2B variants, four of which are male germ cell-specific. We further confirm the absence of protamines in Hydractinia. Since no protamines are found in hydroids, we suggest that the novel H2B variants are pivotal for sperm DNA packaging in this class of Cnidaria. This study adds to the limited number of full histone gene complements available in animals and sets a comprehensive framework for future studies on the role of histones and their post-translational modifications in cnidarian epigenetics.

A group of proteins called histones are partly responsible for regulating gene activity. Like all proteins, histones are made from smaller building blocks called amino acids. Enzymes can chemically modify specific amino acids in histone proteins, which allows the histones to switch nearby genes on or off. One of these modifications is called methylation, and the methylation of specific “lysine” amino acids in histone proteins regulates gene activity in different ways.Previous research has shown that, in certain types of cancer cells, lysines that can be methylated are often replaced with another amino acid, a methionine. These substitutions stop the histones from correctly controlling the activity of nearby genes because methionine cannot be methylated like lysine. Additionally, even if only a small number of histones have methionine in place of lysine, this change can have a widespread effect because the few histones with the methionine can block other histones from being methylated too. However, previous studies did not provide a clear mechanism for why this is the case.In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe an enzyme called Clr4 methylates a histone protein at a lysine named H3K9. Now, Shan, Wang, Xu et al. show that substituting this lysine with a methionine (referred to as H3K9M) stops the widespread methylation of histones by trapping the Clr4 enzyme. Specifically, Clr4 becomes stuck to the H3K9M histones, and is therefore unable to modify any other histones. Shan et al. went on to carry out a more detailed study of the structure of H3K9M attached to another enzyme called G9a. This enzyme is found in human cells and is similarly inhibited by H3K9M. This investigation identified additional chemical interactions that explain why Clr4 and G9a become trapped by the H3K9M histone but not by normal histones.Future studies are needed to explore whether other altered histones are able to trap enzymes in the way that H3K9M traps Clr4 and G9a. In addition, this work could eventually lead to new cancer therapies.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17903.002"],"author_name":["Peter L Nagy","Jiyong Wang","John R. Yates","Yates JR","James J.

Our study focuses on the role of histone acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) methylation in the maintenance of the competency of these active genes during mitosis. To this end we have analyzed histone modifications across the promoters and coding regions of constitutively active, inducible, and inactive genes in mitotic arrested cells. Our results show that basal histone modifications are maintained during mitosis at promoters and coding regions of the active and inducible RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes. In addition we have demonstrated that, together with H3 acetylation and H3 (Lys-4) methylation, H4 (Lys-12) acetylation at the coding regions contributes to the formation of a stable mark on active genes at this stage of the cell cycle. Finally, analysis of cyclin B1 gene activation during mitosis revealed that the former occurs with a strong increase of H3 (Lys-4) trimethylation but not H3 or H4 acetylation, suggesting that histone methyltransferases are active during this stage.

Currently, no protein database is ideally suited for the analysis of histones and the complex array of mammalian histone variants. We propose two proteomics-oriented manually curated databases for mouse and human histone variants. We manually curated >1700 gene, transcript and protein entries to produce a non-redundant list of 83 mouse and 85 human histones. These entries were annotated in accordance with the current nomenclature and unified with the “HistoneDB2.0 with Variants” database. This resource is provided in a format that can be directly read by programs used for mass spectrometry data interpretation. In addition, it was used to interpret mass spectrometry data acquired on histones extracted from mouse testis. Several histone variants, which had so far only been inferred by homology or detected at the RNA level, were detected by mass spectrometry, confirming the existence of their protein form. Mouse and human histone entries were collected from different databases and subsequently curated to produce a non-redundant protein-centric resource, MS_HistoneDB.

Every time a eukaryotic cell divides, it must duplicate its DNA. Old histones are first removed from the nucleosomes before being re-assembled onto the newly duplicated DNA along with new histone proteins, producing a full complement of nucleosomes.A group of proteins called the chromatin assembly factor 1 (or CAF-1 for short) helps to assemble the histones onto the DNA. CAF-1 is made up of three proteins, and binds to two copies of each of the histones known as H3 and H4. These are the first histones to be assembled onto the nucleosomes. It was not clear how the components of CAF-1 are organized, or how CAF-1 recognizes histones.Liu et al. have now investigated the structure of CAF-1 and its interactions with the H3 and H4 histones by studying yeast proteins and cells. Yeast is a good model system because yeast CAF-1 is smaller and easier to isolate than human CAF-1, yet still performs the same essential activities. Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques, Liu et al. found that one of the three proteins that makes up yeast CAF-1 – called Cac1 – forms a scaffold that supports the other CAF-1 proteins and histones H3 and H4. Moreover, a specific part of Cac1 is able to bind to these histones and assemble two copies of each of them to prepare for efficient nucleosome assembly.Further experiments revealed the specific areas where the CAF-1 proteins interact with each other and with the histones, determined how strong those interactions are, and confirmed that these interactions play important roles in yeast.Overall, the results presented by Liu et al. provide new insights into the structure of CAF-1 bound to H3 and H4. In order to understand in detail how CAF-1 helps to assemble histones onto DNA, future work needs to capture three-dimensional snapshots of the different steps in this process. Further investigation is also needed to discover how CAF-1 cooperates with other factors that promote DNA duplication.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18023.002"],"author_name":["Kirk C Hansen","Mair EA Churchill","Briana K Dennehey","Shen ZJ","Ahn NG","Balsbaugh JL","Sarah C.

However, our understanding about their composition and their functions is limited. Integrating proteomic and genomic approaches, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic landscapes containing the four histone variants H3.1, H3.3, H2A.Z, and macroH2A. These histones were FLAG-tagged in HeLa cells and purified using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). By adopting ChIP followed by mass spectrometry (ChIP-MS), we quantified histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and histone variant nucleosomal ratios in highly purified mononucleosomes. Subsequent ChIP followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to map the genome-wide localization of the analyzed histone variants and define their chromatin domains. Finally, we included in our study large datasets contained in the ENCODE database. We newly identified a group of regulatory regions enriched in H3.1 and the histone variant associated with repressive marks macroH2A. Systematic analysis identified both symmetric and asymmetric patterns of histone variant occupancies at intergenic regulatory regions. Strikingly, these directional patterns were associated with RNA polymerase II (PolII). These asymmetric patterns correlated with the enhancer activities measured using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) data. Our studies show that H2A.Z and H3.3 delineate the orientation of transcription at enhancers as observed at promoters. We also showed that enhancers with skewed histone variant patterns well facilitate enhancer activity. Collectively, our study indicates that histone variants are deposited at regulatory regions to assist gene regulation."],"author_name":["Kyoung-Jae Won","Simone Sidoli","Zee BM","Won KJ","Gonzales-Cope M","Benjamin A Garcia","Choi I.","BenjaminAGarcia ","Gary LeRoy","GaryLeRoy ","Leroy G ","InchanChoi ","Kyoung-JaeWon ","MichelleGonzales-Cope ","Inchan Choi","Barry M Zee","Garcia BA","SimoneSidoli ","BarryMZee ","Michelle Gonzales-Cope","Sidoli S"],"author_slug":["kyoung-jae-won/229467","simone-sidoli/1128623","zee-bm/13387867","won-kj/11936333","gonzales-cope-m/14464750","benjamin-a-garcia/622567","choi-i/8909734","benjaminagarcia/15073106","gary-leroy/93285","garyleroy/15073101","leroy-g/10062225","inchanchoi/15212771","kyoung-jaewon/15212770","michellegonzales-cope/15212772","inchan-choi/1531502","barry-m-zee/622566","garcia-ba/11616227","simonesidoli/15088228","barrymzee/15073105","michelle-gonzales-cope/1560145","sidoli-s/14471071"],"citation_count":[7],"doi":["10.1186/s13072-015-0005-9"],"html_url":["https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-015-0005-9"],"id":[1001387],"impact_factor":["4.873"],"impact_factor_int":[4],"journal":["Epigenetics & Chromatin"],"keywords":["Histone Variant, Asymmetric Pattern, CTCF Binding, Histone PTMs, Canonical Histone"],"pub_date":["2015-04-10"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Methodology"],"slug":["1001387-proteogenomics-analysis-reveals-specific-genomic-orientations-of-distal-regulatory-regions-composed-by-non-canonical-histone-variants"],"title":["Proteogenomics analysis reveals specific genomic orientations of distal regulatory regions composed by non-canonical histone variants"]},"id":139072},{"score":27.023409,"doc":{"abstract":["Histone methylation levels, which are determined by the action of both histone demethylases and methyltransferases, impact multiple biological processes by affecting gene expression activity.

In this study, the expression of histone H3 acetyl K9, which is known to denote active regions at enhancers and promoters, and histone H3 tri methyl K4, which preferentially identifies active gene promoters, were examined as both show high metastatic potential. A panel of patients with cervical cancer was selected and the importance of the histone modifications concerning survival-time (overall survival and relapse-free survival) was analyzed in 250 cases. Histone H3 acetyl K9 staining was correlated with low grading, low FIGO (TNM classification and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) status, negative N-status and low T-status in cervical cancer, showing a higher expression in adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma. Cytoplasmic expression of histone H3 tri methyl K4 in a cervical cancer specimen was correlated with advanced T-status and poor prognosis. While cytoplasmic H3K4me3 expression seemed to be a marker of relapse-free survival, nuclear expression showed a correlation to poor prognosis in overall survival. Within this study, we analyzed the chemical modification of two histone proteins that are connected to active gene expression. Histone H3 acetyl K9 was found to be an independent marker of overall survival. Histone H3 tri methyl K4 was correlated with poor prognosis and it was found to be an independent marker of relapse-free survival.

Together with DNA methylation, histone modifications (including histone acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, etc.) represent the classical epigenetic mechanisms. However, much less attention has been given to histone modifications than to DNA methylation in the context of allergy. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to provide an unbiased and comprehensive update on the involvement of histone modifications in allergy and the mechanisms underlying this development. In addition to covering the growing interest in the contribution of histone modifications in regulating the development of allergic diseases, this review summarizes some of the evidence supporting this contribution. There are at least two levels at which the role of histone modifications is manifested. One is the regulation of cells that contribute to the allergic inflammation (T cells and macrophages) and those that participate in airway remodeling [(myo-) fibroblasts]. The other is the direct association between histone modifications and allergic phenotypes. Inhibitors of histone-modifying enzymes may potentially be used as anti-allergic drugs. Furthermore, epigenetic patterns may provide novel tools in the diagnosis of allergic disorders."],"author_name":["Renz H","Antonio Ferrante","Potaczek DP","RaziKhalaila ","Verena Bülow","Alhamdan F ","Susan L Prescott","von Bülow V","Razi Khalaila","Garn H","Fahd Alhamdan","HaraldRenz ","JohannaWolf ","Hani Harb","Holger Garn","Wolf J","SusanL.Prescott ","BilalAlaskharAlhamwe ","Daniel P.

The extraordinary density of chromatin creates an obstacle for accessing the genetic information. Regulation of chromatin dynamics is therefore critical to cellular homeostasis, and histone chaperones serve as prominent players in these processes. In the current study, we examined the role of specific histone chaperones in negotiating the inherently repressive chromatin structure during transcriptional activation. Using a model promoter, we demonstrate that the human nucleosome assembly protein family members hNap1 and SET/Taf1β stimulate transcription in vitro during pre-initiation complex formation, prior to elongation. This stimulatory effect is dependent upon the presence of activators, p300, and Acetyl-CoA. We show that transcription from our chromatin template is strongly repressed by H1, and that both histone chaperones enhance RNA synthesis by overcoming H1-induced repression. Importantly, both hNap1 and SET/Taf1β directly bind H1, and function to enhance transcription by evicting the linker histone from chromatin reconstituted with H1. In vivo studies demonstrate that SET/Taf1β, but not hNap1, strongly stimulates activated transcription from the chromosomally-integrated model promoter, consistent with the observation that SET/Taf1β is nuclear, whereas hNap1 is primarily cytoplasmic. Together, these observations indicate that SET/Taf1β may serve as a critical regulator of H1 dynamics and gene activation in vivo. These studies uncover a novel function for SET that mechanistically couples transcriptional derepression with H1 dynamics. Furthermore, they underscore the significance of chaperone-dependent H1 displacement as an essential early step in the transition of a promoter from a dense chromatin state into one that is permissive to transcription factor binding and robust activation."],"author_name":["Holli A.

The nucleomorphs of the two groups have evolved in a remarkably convergent manner, with numerous very similar features. Chief among them is the extreme reduction and compaction of nucleomorph genomes, with very small chromosomes and extremely short or even completely absent intergenic spaces. These characteristics pose a number of intriguing questions regarding the mechanisms of transcription and gene regulation in such a crowded genomic context, in particular in terms of the functioning of the histone code, which is common to almost all eukaryotes and plays a central role in chromatin biology.<h3>Results</h3>This study examines the sequences of nucleomorph histone proteins in order to address these issues. Remarkably, all classical transcription- and repression-related components of the histone code seem to be missing from chlorarachniophyte nucleomorphs. Cryptophyte nucleomorph histones are generally more similar to the conventional eukaryotic state; however, they also display significant deviations from the typical histone code. Based on the analysis of specific components of the code, we discuss the state of chromatin and the transcriptional machinery in these nuclei.<h3>Conclusions</h3>The results presented here shed new light on the mechanisms of nucleomorph transcription and gene regulation and provide a foundation for future studies of nucleomorph chromatin and transcriptional biology.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13062-016-0119-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."],"author_name":["Georgi K Marinov","Michael Lynch","Marinov GK","Lynch M"],"author_slug":["georgi-k-marinov/1291176","michael-lynch/179759","marinov-gk/13915369","lynch-m/10936097"],"citation_count":[2],"doi":["10.1186/s13062-016-0119-4"],"html_url":["https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13062-016-0119-4"],"id":[1248779],"impact_factor":["2.72"],"impact_factor_int":[2],"journal":["Biology Direct"],"keywords":["Histones,Nucleomorphs,Histone code,Transcription,Chromatin"],"pub_date":["2016-04-05"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Research article"],"slug":["1248779-conservation-and-divergence-of-the-histone-code-in-nucleomorphs"],"title":["Conservation and divergence of the histone code in nucleomorphs"]},"id":352522},{"score":26.670218,"doc":{"abstract":["This is a review of mechanisms that contribute to testis-specific transcription of the histone H1t gene.The mammalian testis-specific histone H1t gene is transcribed only in primary spermatocytes during spermatogenesis.

Furthermore, linker histones contribute to regulation of transcription of specific genes.

Expression of mouse TK mRNA is controlled by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms including antisense transcription. Here we report the identification of a novel gene that is divergently transcribed from the bidirectional TK promoter. This gene encodes kynurenine formamidase (KF), an enzyme of the tryptophan metabolism. Whereas the TK gene is induced upon interleukin-2-mediated activation of resting T cells, the KF gene becomes simultaneously repressed. The TK promoter is regulated by E2F, SP1, histone acetyltransferases, and deacetylases. The binding site for the growth-regulated transcription factor E2F is beneficial for TK promoter activity but not required for KF expression. In contrast, the SP1 binding site is crucial for transcription in both directions. Inhibition of histone deacetylases by trichostatin A leads to increased histone acetylation at the TK/KF promoter and thereby to selective activation of the TK promoter and simultaneous shut-off of KF expression. Similarly, TK gene activation by interleukin-2 is linked to histone hyperacetylation, whereas KF expression correlates with reduced histone acetylation. The KF gene is the rare example of a mammalian gene whose expression is linked to histone hypoacetylation at its promoter."],"author_name":["Doetzlhofer Angelika ","Kroboth K","Wintersberger E.","Schuettengruber Bernd ","Seiser C","Wintersberger Erhard ","Doetzlhofer A","Seiser Christian","Schuettengruber B","Kroboth Karin "],"author_slug":["doetzlhofer-angelika/22113148","kroboth-k/13834716","wintersberger-e/8619973","schuettengruber-bernd/22113147","seiser-c/11556012","wintersberger-erhard/22113150","doetzlhofer-a/13146275","seiser-christian/8845178","schuettengruber-b/13421563","kroboth-karin/22113149"],"citation_count":[30],"doi":["10.1074/jbc.M204843200"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M204843200"],"id":[19527483],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["The Journal of biological chemistry"],"keywords":["histone modification,"],"pub_date":["2003-01-01"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":[""],"slug":["19527483-alternate-activation-of-two-divergently-transcribed-mouse-genes-from-a-bidirectional-promoter-is-linked-to-changes-in-histone-modification"],"title":["Alternate activation of two divergently transcribed mouse genes from a bidirectional promoter is linked to changes in histone modification."]},"id":83585},{"score":26.384336,"doc":{"abstract":["With the aim of discovering contribution of histone H1 to linking number changes of DNA, determination of linking number differences between histone H1-free circular polynucleosomes and histone H1-bound circular polynucleosomes was carried out during our investigations.

At low salt concentrations, the activity of the transferase with agmatine as acceptor was less than 10% that observed in the presence of 200 mM NaCl. In the absence of salts, ADP-ribosylation of agmatine was stimulated greater than 10-fold by histones, and activity approached that observed with high salt concentration; under these conditions, the histones did not serve as ADP-ribose acceptors themselves. Histone also activated the highly purified ADP-ribosyltransferase from human erythrocytes. Enzyme activity was increased in the presence of salt and was then relatively independent of histones. DNA was not required for the stimulation of ADP-ribosylation by histone; incubation of the transferase and histone with DNase did not significantly decrease enzymatic activity. Additional DNA in the assay decreased the effect of histone. The erythrocyte ADP-ribosyltransferase from diverse species thus appears to exist in two forms: one is dependent on histones for activity and one which, in the presence of salt, has high intrinsic activity and is independent of histone. The fact that the active forms of the transferase generated in the presence of salt or histone have similar catalytic activity suggests that these forms of transferase may be identical.

Molecular dynamics and free energy simulations based on quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics potential supported the experimental findings by providing an insight into the geometry and energetics of the enzymatic methyl/ethyl transfer process."],"author_name":[" Prof. Dr. Elmar Weinhold"," Prof. Dr. Jasmin Mecinović"," Prof. Dr. Hong Guo"," Dr. Michael Martin"," Dr. Ping Qian","Danny C.

The precise organization of chromatin is essential for faithful execution of DNA-mediated reactions such as transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair and DNA recombination. The organization of chromatin is considered to be regulated by a variety of post-translational modifications of histones, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation and poly-ADP-ribosylation. The relationship between histone acetylation and gene expression was first observed in 1964. Since then, a great deal of evidence has accumulated showing that not only transcription but other DNA-mediated reactions also are regulated by histone acetylation. With regard to the putative mechanism(s) by which histone acetylation regulates the flow of genetic information, site-specific modification and recognition of acetylated histone/DNA complexes have been postulated. Elucidation of the downstream effects of histone modification, as well as the identification, isolation and characterization of the relevant factors involved, have aided in our understanding of the mechanisms of regulation of DNA activity by histones. Currently, state-of-the-art technologies that enable genome-wide analysis are allowing insight into a critical and interesting question in eukaryotic transcription: are the principles that govern transcription of individual gene loci applicable to the genome as a whole?

The main components involved in chromatin assembly are specific complexes such as Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF-1) and Histone Regulator (HIR), which deposit histones in a DNA synthesis-dependent or -independent manner, respectively. Here, we characterize the role of the plant orthologs Histone Regulator A (HIRA), Ubinuclein (UBN) and Calcineurin Binding protein 1 (CABIN1), which constitute the HIR complex. Arabidopsis loss-of-function mutants for the various subunits of the complex are viable, but hira mutants show reduced fertility. We show that loss of HIRA reduces extractable histone H3 protein levels and decreases nucleosome occupancy at both actively transcribed genes and heterochromatic regions. Concomitantly, HIRA contributes to maintenance of silencing of pericentromeric repeats and certain transposons. A genetic analysis based on crosses between mutants deficient in subunits of the CAF-1 and HIR complexes showed that simultaneous loss of both the CAF-1 and HIR histone H3 chaperone complexes severely affects plant survival, growth and reproductive development. Our results suggest that HIRA partially rescues impaired histone deposition in fas mutants to preserve nucleosome occupancy, implying plasticity in histone variant interaction and deposition.

In a standard microdilution assay, calf thymus histones H2B, H3, and H4 showed growth inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus with minimum effective concentration values of 4.0, 4.0, and 5.6 μM, respectively. Laser confocal microscopic analyses revealed that both the Arg-rich and Lys-rich histones associated with the surface of S. aureus. However, while the morphology of S. aureus treated with histone H2B appeared intact, those treated with the histones H3 and H4 closely resembled each other, and the cells were blurred. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay results revealed these histones have binding affinity to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), one of major cell surface components of Gram-positive bacteria. Scanning electron microscopic analyses demonstrated that while histone H2B elicited no obvious changes in cell morphology, histones H3 and H4 disrupted the cell membrane structure with bleb formation in a manner similar to general antimicrobial peptides. Consequently, our results suggest that bacterial cell surface LTA initially attracts both the Arg- and Lys-rich histones, but the modes of antimicrobial action of these histones are different; the former involves cell membrane disruption and the latter involves the cell integrity disruption."],"author_name":["Miyaji K","Shiraishi T.","Morita S.","Shuu Morita ","Iwamuro S","Takayuki Shiraishi ","Tagai C","Kazuyuki Miyaji ","Chihiro Tagai ","Shawichi Iwamuro"],"author_slug":["miyaji-k/11269475","shiraishi-t/8965074","morita-s/8593211","shuu-morita/27957141","iwamuro-s/10919532","takayuki-shiraishi/21225305","tagai-c/14494888","kazuyuki-miyaji/22041306","chihiro-tagai/27957142","shawichi-iwamuro/7222000"],"citation_count":[22],"doi":["10.1016/j.peptides.2013.07.025"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2013.07.025"],"id":[20913082],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Peptides"],"keywords":["Antimicrobial peptides, Gram-positive bacteria, Histone H2B, Histone H3, Histone H4, Lipoteichoic acid"],"pub_date":["2013-08-13"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Journal article"],"slug":["20913082-differential-mode-of-antimicrobial-actions-of-arginine-rich-and-lysine-rich-histones-against-gram-positive-staphylococcus-aureus"],"title":["Differential mode of antimicrobial actions of arginine-rich and lysine-rich histones against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus."]},"id":881499},{"score":26.148657,"doc":{"abstract":["Histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) help regulate DNA templated processes; however, relatively little work has unbiasedly explored the single-molecule combinations of histone PTMs, their dynamics on short timescales, or how these preexisting histone PTMs modulate further histone modifying enzyme activity.

Drought stress, a very common environmental stress, could cause a range of physiological and biochemical responses in plants involving HATs. Eight HATs in four different families (CBP, GNAT, MYST, and TAF(II)250 family) are known in rice. In this research, four OsHATs, one from each family, were chosen based on in silico domain and promoter analysis for their response under drought conditions. Drought stress was introduced to two-leaf-stage rice seedlings. The effectiveness of drought treatment was confirmed by the measurement of relative water content (RWC). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that drought stress caused a significant increase in the expression of four HATs (OsHAC703, OsHAG703, OsHAF701 and OsHAM701) in rice plants. Additionally, the Western-blot analysis showed that the acetylation level on certain lysine sites of H3 (lysine 9, lysine 18 and lysine 27) and H4 (lysine 5) increased with OsHATs expression.

Further, there are currently over 100 clinical trials involving the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors in a wide range of solid and hematological malignancies. The therapeutic potential of histone deacetylase inhibitors has also been investigated for numerous other diseases. For example, the cytotoxic properties of histone deacetylase inhibitors are currently being harnessed as a potential treatment for malaria, whereas the efficacy of these compounds for HIV relies on de-silencing latent virus. The anti-inflammatory properties of histone deacetylase inhibitors are the predominant mechanisms for other diseases, such as hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and a wide range of neurodegenerative conditions. Additionally, histone deacetylase inhibitors have been shown to be efficacious in animal models of cardiac hypertrophy and asthma. Broad-spectrum histone deacetylase inhibitors are clinically available and have been used almost exclusively in preclinical systems to date.

Manganese neurotoxicity presents with Parkinson-like symptoms, with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia as the principal pathological feature. Manganese neurotoxicity studies may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of Parkinson’s disease. Here, we examined the effects of manganese on histone acetylation, a major epigenetic change in chromatin that can regulate gene expression, chromatin remodelling, cell cycle progression, DNA repair and apoptosis. In this study, we found that manganese chloride (MnCl 2 ) may significantly suppress the acetylation of histone H3 and H4 in PC12 cells and SHSY5Y cells in a time-dependent manner. Then we tested the role of manganese chloride on histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). The results showed that MnCl 2 increased the activity of HDAC but decreased that of HAT in PC12 cells. Further experiments showed that MnCl 2 selectively increased the expression levels of HDAC3 and HDAC4 rather than HDAC1 and HDAC2, but decreased that of HAT in PC12 cells and SHSY5Y cells. Pretreatment with the HAT inhibitor anacardic acid (AA) enhanced manganese-induced decrease in cell viability and apoptosis, but HDAC inhibition by TSA drug had an opposite effect in PC12 cells. Collectively, MnCl 2 inhibited the acetylation of core histones in cell culture models of PD, and that inhibition of HDAC activity by TSA protects against manganese-induced cell death, indicating that histone acetylation may represent key epigenetic changes in manganese-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity.

The ligands affect acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 5 and lysine 8 ex vivo. PI alters the post-translational modifications to a greater extent than EB.

They are also implicated in processes such as DNA repair and apoptosis. However, the study of the phosphorylation of histones has been mainly focused on chromosome condensation and mitosis. Therefore, the phosphorylation of histones in apoptosis is not fully understood. It was recently demonstrated by Tang et al. that histones are released from nucleosome during apoptosis, an observation that is in agreement with our findings. In addition to the release of histones, the dephosphorylation of histone H3 at Thr-3 and Ser-10 was observed during apoptosis in some cancer cells. Our data suggest that the modification and release of histones could serve markers of apoptosis in human cancer cells. We also suggest that the released histones, especially H3, could be translocated to mitochondria during apoptosis.

This central question has been impossible to address because the four core histones that make up the protein core of the nucleosome are so highly conserved in all eukaryotes. With the discovery of small, minimalist histone-like proteins in most known archaea, the likely origin of histones was identified. We recently determined the structure of an archaeal histone-DNA complex, revealing that archaeal DNA topology and protein-DNA interactions are astonishingly similar compared to the eukaryotic nucleosome. This was surprising since most archaeal histones form homodimers which consist only of the minimal histone fold and are devoid of histone tails and extensions. Unlike eukaryotic H2A-H2B and H3-H4 heterodimers that assemble into octameric particles wrapping ~ 150 bp DNA, archaeal histones form polymers around which DNA coils in a quasi-continuous superhelix. At any given point, this superhelix has the same geometry as nucleosomal DNA. This suggests that the architectural role of histones (i.e. the ability to bend DNA into a nucleosomal superhelix) was established before archaea and eukaryotes diverged, while the ability to form discrete particles, together with signaling functions of eukaryotic chromatin (i.e. epigenetic modifications) were secondary additions."],"author_name":["Mattiroli F"," Bhattacharyya S","Luger K"],"author_slug":["mattiroli-f/14472635","bhattacharyya-s/8418365","luger-k/12295590"],"citation_count":[0],"doi":["10.1111/febs.14495"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.14495"],"id":[63363892],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["The FEBS journal"],"keywords":["DNA organization, archaea, chromatin structure, histones, nucleosome"],"pub_date":["2018-05-08"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Journal Article"],"slug":["63363892-archaeal-dna-on-the-histone-merry-go-round"],"title":["Archaeal DNA on the histone merry-go-round."]},"id":477150},{"score":25.807812,"doc":{"abstract":["At a late stage of spermatogenesis in rainbow-trout testis, the entire complement of histones is replaced by newly synthesized protamine and histones are extensively phosphorylated and acetylated.

However, our understanding of how histone modifications directly affect chromatin function remains limited. In this study, we investigate acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 64 (H3K64ac), a previously uncharacterized acetylation on the lateral surface of the histone octamer. We show that H3K64ac regulates nucleosome stability and facilitates nucleosome eviction and hence gene expression in vivo. In line with this, we demonstrate that H3K64ac is enriched in vivo at the transcriptional start sites of active genes and it defines transcriptionally active chromatin. Moreover, we find that the p300 co-activator acetylates H3K64, and consistent with a transcriptional activation function, H3K64ac opposes its repressive counterpart H3K64me3. Our findings reveal an important role for a histone modification within the nucleosome core as a regulator of chromatin function and they demonstrate that lateral surface modifications can define functionally opposing chromatin states.

In addition, large-scale mass spectrometry screens have revealed that histone H3 phosphorylation can occur at multiple sites within its globular domain, yet detailed analyses of the functions of these phosphorylations are lacking. Here, we explore one such histone H3 phosphorylation site, threonine 80 (H3T80), which is located on the nucleosome surface. Phosphorylated H3T80 (H3T80ph) is enriched in metazoan cells undergoing mitosis. Unlike H3S10 and H3S28, H3T80 is not phosphorylated by the Aurora B kinase. Further, mutations of T80 to either glutamic acid, a phosphomimetic, or to alanine, an unmodifiable residue, result in an increase in cells in prophase and an increase in anaphase/telophase bridges, respectively. SILAC-coupled mass spectrometry shows that phosphorylated H3T80 (H3T80ph) preferentially interacts with histones H2A and H4 relative to non-phosphorylated H3T80, and this result is supported by increased binding of H3T80ph to histone octamers in vitro. These findings support a model where H3T80ph, protruding from the nucleosome surface, promotes interactions between adjacent nucleosomes to promote chromatin compaction during mitosis in metazoan cells.

On the other hand, the stability of histone mRNAs and the destabilization of histone mRNAs when DNA replication is completed or inhibited are highly selective, tightly coupled and largely post-transcriptionally controlled.

These unbound histones could modify the histone translation complex, via interactions with polysomal histone mRNAs, in such a manner as to render histone mRNAs accessible to cellular ribonucleases.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains ten of these importins, but only two of them are essential. After transfer through the nuclear pore, importins release their cargo upon binding to the Ran GTPase, the key regulator of nuclear transport. We investigated the import of the core histones in yeast and found that four importins are involved. The essential Pse1p and the nonessential importins Kap114p, Kap104p, and Yrb4p/Kap123p specifically bind to histones H2A and H2B. Release of H2 histones from importins requires Ran-GTP and DNA simultaneously suggesting a function of the importins in intranuclear targeting. H3 and H4 associate mainly with Pse1p and the dissociation requires Ran but not DNA, which points to a different import mechanism. Import of green fluorescent protein fusions to H2A and H2B requires primarily Pse1p and Kap114p, whereas Yrb4p plays an auxiliary role. Pse1p is predominantly necessary for nuclear uptake of H3 and H4, while Kap104p and Yrb4p also support import. We conclude from our in vivo and in vitro experiments that import of the essential histones is mediated mainly by the essential importin Pse1p, while the non-essential Kap114p functions in a parallel import pathway for H2A and H2B."],"author_name":["M.

Upon injury, the skin triggers a sequence of signaling pathways that induce epithelial proliferation, migration, and ultimately, the re-establishment of the epithelial barrier. Our study explores the unknown epigenetic regulations of wound healing from a histone perspective. Posttranslational modifications of histones enhance chromatin accessibility and modify gene transcription. Methods Full-thickness wounds were made in the dorsal skin of twenty-four C57/B6 mice (C57BL/6J), followed by the use of ring-shaped silicone splints to prevent wound contraction. Tissue samples were collected at three time points (post-operatory day 1, 4, and 9), and processed for histology. Immunofluorescence was performed in all-time points using markers for histone H4 acetylation at lysines K5, K8, K12, and K16. Results We found well-defined histone modifications associated with the stages of healing. Most exciting, we showed that the epidermis located at a distance from the wound demonstrated changes in histone acetylation, particularly the deacetylation of histone H4K5, H4K8, and H4K16, and hyperacetylation of H4K12. The epidermis adjacent to the wound revealed the deacetylation of H4K5 and H4K8 and hyperacetylation of H4K12. Conversely, the migratory epithelium (epithelial tongue) displayed significant acetylation of H4K5 and H4K12. The H4K5 and H4K8 were decreased in the newly formed epidermis, which continued to display high levels of H4K12 and H4K16. Conclusions This study profiles the changes in histone H4 acetylation in response to injury. In addition to the epigenetic changes found in the healing tissue, these changes also took place in tissues adjacent and distant to the wound. Furthermore, not only deacetylation but also hyperacetylation occurred during tissue repair and regeneration."],"author_name":["Eny M Goloni-Bertollo","LeliaBatistadeSouza ","RogerioM.Castilho ","CarlosH.V.Nascimento-Filho ","Lélia Batista de Souza","Cristiane H.

Remarkably, SAHF-positive senescent cells lose linker histone H1 and exhibit increased levels of chromatin-bound high mobility group A2 (HMGA2). The expression of N-terminally enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged histone H1 induces premature senescence phenotypes, including increased levels of phosphorylated p53, p21, and hypophosphorylated Rb, and a decrease in the chromatin-bound endogenous histone H1 level but not in p16 level accumulation or SAHF formation. However, the simultaneous ectopic expression of hemagglutinin-tagged HMGA2 and N-terminally EGFP-tagged histone H1 leads to significant SAHF formation (P < 0.001).

Mutation of this motif in budding yeast cells does not affect DNA synthesis, but instead abrogates gene silencing at telomeres and mating-type loci. Similar phenotypes are produced not only by mutations that displace Pol α from the replisome, but also by mutation of the previously identified histone-binding motif in the CMG helicase subunit Mcm2, the human orthologue of which was shown to bind to histones H3 and H4. We show that chromatin-derived histone complexes can be bound simultaneously by Mcm2, Pol α and the histone chaperone FACT that is also a replisome component. These findings indicate that replisome assembly unites multiple histone-binding activities, which jointly process parental histones to help preserve silent chromatin during the process of chromosome duplication."],"author_name":["Diamante A","Maman JD","Labib K","PELLEGRINI L ","Evrin C"],"author_slug":["diamante-a/11888108","maman-jd/13216526","labib-k/11239855","pellegrini-l/8790348","evrin-c/13365570"],"citation_count":[0],"doi":["10.15252/embj.201899021"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.15252/embj.201899021"],"id":[63537148],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["The EMBO journal"],"keywords":["DNA polymerase alpha, DNA replication, histone chaperone, histones, replisome"],"pub_date":["2018-08-15"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Journal Article"],"slug":["63537148-histone-h2a-h2b-binding-by-pol-a-in-the-eukaryotic-replisome-contributes-to-the-maintenance-of-repressive-chromatin"],"title":["Histone H2A-H2B binding by Pol α in the eukaryotic replisome contributes to the maintenance of repressive chromatin."]},"id":652926},{"score":25.640064,"doc":{"abstract":["Covalent modifications of histones can regulate all DNA-dependent processes.

There is limited information regarding the pathogenic role of circulating histones in neuroinflammation and cerebrovascular endothelial injury. Particularly, it remains unclear whether histones affect the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability function. The direct effects of unfractionated histones on endothelial barrier properties were first assessed in brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers by measuring transendothelial electrical resistance and solute flux. This was followed by in vivo mouse experiments, where BBB function was assessed by quantifying brain tissue accumulation of intravenously injected tracers of different molecular sizes, and comparison was made in mice receiving a sublethal dose of histones versus sterile saline. In parallel, the endothelial barrier ultrastructure was examined in histone- and saline-injected animals under transmission electron microscopy, corresponding to the expression of tight junction and adherens junction proteins. Histones increased paracellular permeability to sodium fluorescein and reduced barrier resistance at 100 μg/mL; these responses were accompanied by discontinuous staining of the tight junction proteins claudin-5 and zona ocludens-1. Interestingly, the effects of histones did not seem to result from cytotoxicity, as evidenced by negative propidium iodide staining. In vivo, histones increased the paracellular permeability of the BBB to small tracers of < 1-kDa, whereas tracers larger than 3-kDa remained impermeable across brain microvessels. Further analysis of different brain regions showed that histone-induced tracer leakage and loss of tight junction protein expression mainly occurred in the hippocampus, but not in the cerebral cortex. Consistently, opening of tight junctions was found in hippocampal capillaries from histone-injected animals. Protein expression levels of GFAP and iBA1 remained unchanged in histone-injected mice indicating that histones did not affect reactive gliosis. Moreover, cell membrane surface charge alterations are involved in histone-induced barrier dysfunction and tight junction disruption. Extracellular histones cause a reversible, region-specific increase in BBB permeability to small molecules by disrupting tight junctions in the hippocampus. We suggest that circulating histones may contribute to cerebrovascular injury or brain dysfunction by altering BBB structure and function."],"author_name":["Sheon Baby ","Byeong J.

The ability of trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, to potentiate the estradiol (E2) induction of progesterone receptor (PR) levels in MCF-7 cells was studied. Although TSA alone had no effect on PR synthesis, measured by a whole-cell binding assay with [3H]R5020, TSA potentiated the effect of 10−11 M E2 such that 10 ng of TSA/mL approximately doubled the hormone response. When TSA was removed from the cells after various incubation times (24 and 48 h) by successive washings with TSA-free medium, it was determined that TSA was required throughout the 96-h incubation period in order to achieve maximal potentiation for the E2 response. In addition, TSA potentiated E2 induction of pS2 mRNA. These results suggested that the estrogen receptor (ER) complex might alter histone acetylation as part of the gene activation process. To test this directly, MCF-7 cells were incubated for 48 h with E2 followed by incubation with sodium [3H]acetate for 1 h. From two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, an increase in total acetate incorporation into histones in estrogen- treated cells compared to control was observed as well as a preferential increase in the mono-and diacetylated histone H4.

Subjects with FASD show significant neurological deficits, ranging from microencephaly, neurobehavioral, and mental health problems to poor social adjustment and stress tolerance. Neurons are particularly sensitive to alcohol exposure. The neurotoxic action of alcohol, i.e., through ROS production, induces DNA damage and neuronal cell death by apoptosis. In addition, epigenetics, including DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and non-coding RNA, play an important role in the neuropathology of FASD. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics and kinetics of histones and their PTMs in FASD. Results We examined the effects of postnatal alcohol exposure (PAE), an animal model of human third-trimester equivalent, on the kinetics of various histone proteins in two distinct brain regions, the frontal cortex, and the hypothalamus, using in vivo 2H2O-labeling combined with mass spectrometry-based proteomics. We show that histones have long half-lives that are in the order of days. We also show that H3.3 and H2Az histone variants have faster turnovers than canonical histones and that acetylated histones, in general, have a faster turnover than unmodified and methylated histones. Our work is the first to show that PAE induces a differential reduction in turnover rates of histones in both brain regions studied. These alterations in histone turnover were associated with increased DNA damage and decreased cell proliferation in postnatal rat brain. Conclusion Alterations in histone turnover might interfere with histone deposition and chromatin stability, resulting in deregulated cell-specific gene expression and therefore contribute to the development of the neurological disorders associated with FASD. Using in vivo 2H2O-labeling and mass spectrometry-based proteomics might help in the understanding of histone turnover following alcohol exposure and could be of great importance in enabling researchers to identify novel targets and/or biomarkers for the prevention and management of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders."],"author_name":["Kasumov T","Sarkar D.

Sarcomas are a rare group of malignant tumors originating from mesenchymal stem cells. Surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are currently the only standard treatments for sarcoma. However, their response rates to chemotherapy are quite low. Toxic side effects and multi-drug chemoresistance make treatment even more challenging. Therefore, better drugs to treat sarcomas are needed. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC inhibitors, HDACi, HDIs) are epigenetic modifying agents that can inhibit sarcoma growth in vitro and in vivo through a variety of pathways, including inducing tumor cell apoptosis, causing cell cycle arrest, impairing tumor invasion and preventing metastasis. Importantly, preclinical studies have revealed that HDIs can not only sensitize sarcomas to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but also increase treatment responses when combined with other chemotherapeutic drugs. Several phase I and II clinical trials have been conducted to assess the efficacy of HDIs either as monotherapy or in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents or targeted therapeutic drugs for sarcomas. Combination regimen for sarcomas appear to be more promising than monotherapy when using HDIs.

The expression of histone methyltransferases (EHMT1 and EHZ2) and level of global histone trimethylation (H3K9 and H3K27) have been assessed and observed to be increased significantly after fluoride exposure (8 mg/L). EpiTect chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) qPCR Array (Human TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway) was performed to assess the H3K9 trimethylation at promoter regions of pathway-specific genes. H3K9 ChIP PCR array analysis identified hyper H3K9 trimethylation in promoter regions of TGFBR2 and SMAD3. qPCR and STRING analysis was carried out to determine the repressive epigenetic effect of H3K9 trimethylation on expression pattern and functional association of identified genes. Identified genes (TGFBR2 and SMAD3) showed down-regulation which confirms the repressive epigenetic effect of promoter H3K9 hyper trimethylation. Expression of two other vital genes COL1A1 and MMP13 involved in TGFBR2-SMAD signaling pathway was also found to be down-regulated with a decrease in expression of TGFBR2 and SMAD3. STRING analysis revealed functional association and involvement of identified genes TGFBR2, SMAD3, COL1A1 and MMP13 in the collagen and cartilage development/morphogenesis, connective tissue formation, bio-mineral tissue development, endochondral bone formation, bone and skeletal morphogenesis.

A number of histone methyltransferases were then tested on these nucleosome substrates.

This KDM2A-H3K36 complex structure, coupled with functional studies, provides needed insight into the process and regulation of histone demethylation.

Non-histone proteins such as condensin complexes contribute to chromosome shaping, but appear not to be necessary for mitotic chromatin compaction. Histone modifications are known to affect chromatin structure. As histones undergo major changes in their post-translational modifications during mitotic entry, we speculated that the spectrum of cell-cycle-specific histone modifications might contribute to chromosome compaction during mitosis. To test this hypothesis, we isolated core histones from interphase and mitotic cells and reconstituted chromatin with them. We used mass spectrometry to show that key post-translational modifications remained intact during our isolation procedure. Light, atomic force and transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that chromatin assembled from mitotic histones has a much greater tendency to aggregate than chromatin assembled from interphase histones, even under low magnesium conditions where interphase chromatin remains as separate beads-on-a-string structures. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that mitotic chromosome formation is a two-stage process with changes in the spectrum of histone post-translational modifications driving mitotic chromatin compaction, while the action of non-histone proteins such as condensin may then shape the condensed chromosomes into their classic mitotic morphology."],"author_name":["Eric C Schirmer","Schirmer EC","Makarov A.","Alisa Zhiteneva","Vagnarelli P","Colby T.","Earnshaw WC","Zhiteneva A","William C.

Posttranslational histone modifications are prime candidates for the regulation of the chromatin struc- ture. In order to understand the maintenance of chromatin structures, it is crucial to understand the replication of histone modification patterns. To study the kinetics of histone modifications in vivo, we have pulse-labeled synchronized cells with an isotopically labeled arginine (15N4) that is 4Da heavier than the naturally occurring 14N4 isoform. As most of the histone synthesis is coupled with replication, the cells were arrested at the G1/S boundary, released into S-phase and simultaneously incubated in the medium containing heavy arginine, thus labeling all newly synthesized proteins. This method allows a comparison of modification patterns on parental versus newly deposited his- tones.

The recent identification of enzymes that antagonize or remove histone methylation offers new opportunities to appreciate histone methylation plasticity in the regulation of epigenetic pathways. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4; also known as PAD4) was the first enzyme shown to antagonize histone methylation. PADI4 functions as a histone deiminase converting a methylarginine residue to citrulline at specific sites on the tails of histones H3 and H4. This activity is linked to repression of the estrogen-regulated pS2 promoter. Very little is known as to how PADI4 silences gene expression. We show here that PADI4 associates with the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). Kinetic chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PADI4 and HDAC1, and the corresponding activities, associate cyclically and coordinately with the pS2 promoter during repression phases. Knockdown of HDAC1 led to decreased H3 citrullination, concomitantly with increased histone arginine methylation. In cells with a reduced HDAC1 and a slightly decreased PADI4 level, these effects were more pronounced. Our data thus suggest that PADI4 and HDAC1 collaborate to generate a repressive chromatin environment on the pS2 promoter. These findings further substantiate the \\'transcriptional clock\\' concept, highlighting the dynamic connection between deimination and deacetylation of histones."],"author_name":["METIVIER R.

Histone lysine methylation has emerged as an important player in regulating gene expression and chromatin function. Lysine (K) 27 (K27) is a critical residue in all seven histone 3 variants and the subject of posttranslational histone modifications, as it can be both methylated and acetylated. In pediatric HGG, two critical single-point mutations occur in the H3F3A gene encoding the regulatory histone variant H3.3. These mutations occur at lysine (K) 27 (K27M) and glycine (G) 34 (G34R/V), both of which are involved with key regulatory posttranscriptional modifications. Therefore, these mutations effect gene expression, cell differentiation, and telomere maintenance. In recent years, alterations in histone acetylation have provided novel opportunities to explore new pharmacological targeting, with histone deacetylase (HDAC) overexpression reported in high-grade, late-stage proliferative tumors.

As a starting point to study the role of histone deacetylases in the control of gene expression and the consequences of their inhibition and activation in the biology of T. cruzi, two inhibitors for different histone deacetylases: trichostatin A for class I/II and sirtinol for class III and the activator resveratrol for class III, were tested on proliferative and infective forms of this parasite. The two inhibitors tested caused histone hyperacetylation whereas resveratrol showed the opposite effect on both parasite forms, indicating that a biologically active in vivo level of these compounds was achieved. Histone deacetylase inhibitors caused life stage-specific effects, increasing trypomastigotes infectivity and blocking metacyclogenesis. Moreover, these inhibitors affected specific transcript levels, with sirtinol causing the most pronounced change. On the other hand, resveratrol showed strong anti-parasitic effects. This compound diminished epimastigotes growth, promoted metacyclogenesis, reduced in vitro infection and blocked differentiation and/or replication of intracellular amastigotes. In conclusion, the data presented here supports the notion that these compounds can modulate T. cruzi gene expression, differentiation, infection and histones deacetylase activity.

These marks co-localize with K9-methylated histone H3 (H3K9me), an abundant gene repression mark. The abundance of H3K9me marks in transcriptionally competent loci decreases when HCS is knocked down and when cells are depleted of biotin. Here we tested the hypothesis that the creation of H3K9me marks is at least partially explained by physical interactions between HCS and histone-lysine N-methyltransferases. Using a novel in silico protocol, we predicted that HCS-interacting proteins contain a GGGG(K/R)G(I/M)R motif. This motif, with minor variations, is present in the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EHMT1. Physical interactions between HCS and the N-terminal, ankyrin and SET domains in EHMT1 were confirmed using yeast-two-hybrid assays, limited proteolysis assays and co-immunoprecipitation. The interactions were stronger between HCS and the N-terminus in EHMT1 compared with the ankyrin and SET domains, consistent with the localization of the HCS-binding motif in the EHMT1 N-terminus. HCS has the catalytic activity to biotinylate K161 within the binding motif in EHMT1. Mutation of K161 weakened the physical interaction between EHMT1 and HCS, but it is unknown whether this effect was caused by loss of biotinylation or loss of the motif. Importantly, HCS knockdown decreased the abundance of H3K9me marks in repeats, suggesting that HCS plays a role in creating histone methylation marks in these loci. We conclude that physical interactions between HCS and EHMT1 mediate epigenomic synergies between biotinylation and methylation events. "],"author_name":["Yousef I.

Our previous investigations showed that in postmeiotic male germ cells, the genome-scale incorporation of histone variants TH2B-H2A.L.2 allows a controlled replacement of histones by protamines to occur. Here, we highlight the intrinsic ability of H2A.L.2 to specifically target the pericentric regions of the genome and discuss why pericentric heterochromatin is a privileged site of histone retention in mature spermatozoa. We observed that the intranuclear localization of H2A.L.2 is controlled by its ability to bind RNA, as well as by an interplay between its RNA-binding activity and its tropism for pericentric heterochromatin. We identify the H2A.L.2 RNA-binding domain and demonstrate that in somatic cells, the replacement of H2A.L.2 RNA-binding motif enhances and stabilizes its pericentric localization, while the forced expression of RNA increases its homogenous nuclear distribution. Based on these data, we propose that the specific accumulation of RNA on pericentric regions combined with H2A.L.2 tropism for these regions are responsible for stabilizing H2A.L.2 on these regions in mature spermatozoa.

In this study we identify a novel activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) as a histone H3-specific protease in chicken liver tissue. This protease activity is regulated by divalent ions and thiol-disulfide conversion in vitro. GDH specifically clips H3 in its free as well as chromatin-bound form. Furthermore, we have found an inhibitor that inhibits the H3-clipping activity of GDH. Like previously reported proteases, GDH too may have the potential to regulate/modulate post-translational modifications of histone H3 by removing the N-terminal residues of the histone. In short, our findings identify an unexpected proteolytic activity of GDH specific to histone H3 that is regulated by redox state, ionic concentrations, and a cellular inhibitor in vitro.

All histones were substrates for platelet adhesion and spreading and triggered fibrinogen binding, aggregation, von Willebrand factor release, P-selectin and phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates; however, H4 was the most potent. Histone-mediated fibrinogen binding, P-selectin and PS exposure and the formation of mixed aggregates were potentiated by thrombin. Histones induced the activation of ERK, Akt, p38 and NFκB. Accordingly, histone-induced platelet activation was significantly impaired by pretreatment of platelets with inhibitors of ERK (U 0126), PI3K/Akt (Ly 294002), p38 (SB 203580) and NFκB (BAY 11-7082 and Ro 106-9920). Preincubation of platelets with either aspirin or dexamethasone markedly decreased fibrinogen binding and the adhesion mediated by histones without affecting P-selectin exposure. Functional platelet responses induced by H3 and H4, but not H1, H2A and H2B, were partially mediated through interaction with Toll-like receptors -2 and -4. Our data identify histones as important triggers of haemostatic and proinflammatory platelet responses, and only haemostatic responses are partially inhibited by anti-inflammatory drugs.

Herein, we investigated potential roles for histone deacetylation (or hypoacetylation) in interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-mediated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) release in insulin-secreting INS 832/13 (INS) cells. Western blot analysis suggested localization of members of Class 1 and Class 2 families of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in these cells. Trichostatin A (TSA), a known inhibitor of HDACs, markedly reduced IL-1β-mediated iNOS expression and NO release from these cells in a concentration-dependent manner. TSA also promoted hyperacetylation of histone H4 under conditions in which it inhibited IL-1β-mediated effects on isolated β cells. Rottlerin, a known inhibitor of protein kinase Cδ, also increased histone H4 acetylation, and inhibited IL-1β-induced iNOS expression and NO release in these cells. It appears that the putative mechanism underlying the stimulatory effects of rottlerin on acetylation status of histone H4 are distinct from the HDAC inhibitory property of TSA, since rottlerin failed to inhibit HDAC activity in nuclear extracts isolated from INS cells. These data are suggestive of potential regulatory effects of rottlerin at the level of increasing the histone acetyltransferase activity in these cells. Together our studies present the first evidence to suggest a PKCδ-mediated signalling step, which promotes hypoacetylation of candidate histones culminating in IL-1β-induced metabolic dysfunction of the isolated β cell."],"author_name":["Hadden T","Susick L","A Kowluru","Kowluru A","Veluthakal R","T Hadden","R Veluthakal","L Susick","M V Suresh","Suresh MV"],"author_slug":["hadden-t/11782770","susick-l/30728730","a-kowluru/1752422","kowluru-a/11427393","veluthakal-r/13381920","t-hadden/1752421","r-veluthakal/1752419","l-susick/1752418","m-v-suresh/1752420","suresh-mv/13030325"],"citation_count":[10],"doi":["10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00171.x"],"html_url":["http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1582-4934.2007.00171.x"],"id":[735684],"impact_factor":["4.753"],"impact_factor_int":[4],"journal":["Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine"],"keywords":["apoptosis,β-cell,histones,histone deacetylases,iNOS, PKCδ"],"pub_date":["2007-12-05"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Research article"],"slug":["735684-regulatory-roles-for-histone-deacetylation-in-il-1b-induced-nitric-oxide-release-in-pancreatic-b-cells"],"title":["Regulatory roles for histone deacetylation in IL-1β-induced nitric oxide release in pancreatic β-cells"]},"id":7529411},{"score":25.18352,"doc":{"abstract":["Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by the production of autoantibodies directed against several nuclear components, such as DNA and histones.

The objective of this study was to assess comprehensively the levels of autoantibodies against histone, DNA and nucleosome antigens in a population of lupus dogs. The specificities of antibodies in lupus and control dog sera were determined using IgM- and IgG-specific reagents in an ELISA against a variety of chromatin antigens. When compared with control sera, IgG antibodies to individual histones H1, H2A, H3 and H4 were significantly higher in the lupus group. In contrast, we did not detect IgG antibodies specific for H2B, H2A-H2B, DNA, H2A-H2B-DNA or nucleosome in lupus dogs. There was no significant increase in any of the IgM specificities tested. Therefore, the reactivity pattern to nucleosome antigens in canine lupus is restricted to IgG antibodies against individual histones H1, H2A, H3 and H4. This stands in contrast with human and murine lupus, where autoantibodies are directed against a wide variety of nucleosomal determinants, suggesting that unique mechanisms lead to the expansion of anti-histone antibody clones in canine lupus. The high incidence of glomerulonephritis in dog lupus suggests that anti-DNA antibodies are not required for the development of this complication, whereas IgG anti-histone antibodies may be relevant to its pathogenesis."],"author_name":["Karam ET","J.

H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels were increased in oncocytoma. H3K4me1-3 levels were inversely correlated with Fuhrman grading, pT stage, lymph node involvement and distant metastasis. Progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival were shorter in patients with low levels of H3K4me1-3 in the univariate analysis, but we did not observe a significant correlation of a single modification in a multivariate model, which also included the established prognostic parameters TNM-stage and Fuhrman grade. In comparison, the H3K4me score, which combined staining levels of the H3K4 modifications, was an independent predictor of RCC progression-free survival.

Accumulated evidence has shown that histone modifications mediate biological processes such as transcription cooperatively. This has led to the hypothesis of 'histone code' which suggests that combinations of different histone modifications correspond to unique chromatin states and have distinct functions. In this paper, we propose a framework based on association rule mining to discover the potential regulatory relations between histone modifications and gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum. Our approach can output rules with statistical significance. Some of the discovered rules are supported by literature of experimental results. Moreover, we have also discovered de novo rules which can guide further research in epigenetic regulation of transcription. Based on our association rules we build a model to predict gene expression, which outperforms a published Bayesian network model for gene expression prediction by histone modifications. The results of our study reveal mechanisms for histone modifications to regulate transcription in large-scale. Among our findings, the cooperation among histone modifications provides new evidence for the hypothesis of histone code. Furthermore, the rules output by our method can be used to predict the change of gene expression.

In an attempt to identify the natural substrate for tTGase, we examined in vitro if core histones were subject to cross-linking by tTGase. We found core histone subunits, H2A and H2B, were specifically cross-linked by tTGase. The cross-linking was between either one or both glutamines at C-terminal end of H2A (-VTIAQ104 GGVLPNTQ112 SVLLPKKTESSKSK-C' end) and the first and/or third lysine from C-terminal end of H2B (-AVESEGK116 AVTKYTSSK125-C' end). The cross-linking occurred only when these subunits were released from nucleosome but not when these were organized in nucleosome. Most interestingly, in chicken erythrocyte the cross-linked H2A-H2B was present in a significant amount.

Indeed, exogenous histones promote both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell migration and invasion through toll-like receptor (TLR)4, but not TLR2 or the receptor for advanced glycosylation end product. TLR4-mediated activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is required for histone-induced chemokine (e.g., C-C motif ligand 9/10) production. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of TLR4-ERK-NF-κB signaling impairs histone-induced chemokine production and HCC cell migration. Additionally, TLR4 depletion (by using TLR4−/− mice and TLR4-shRNA) or inhibition of histone release/activity (by administration of heparin and H3 neutralizing antibody) attenuates lung metastasis of HCC cells injected via the tail vein of mice. Thus, histones promote tumor metastasis of HCC cells through the TLR4-NF-κB pathway and represent novel targets for treating patients with HCC."],"author_name":["Yongmin Fu","Zhen Y"," Kang R"," Wang H","Zeh HJ","Pan P","Fan XG","Daolin Tang","Yan Huang","Michael T Lotze","Yixiang Zhen","YANGCHUN XIE"," Huang Y","Timothy R.

The standardization enabled the correct transformation of 96% of the terms from training and 98% from test the corpus.

In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with chaetocin enhanced apoptosis in human leukemia HL60, KG1, Kasumi, K562, and THP1 cells. In addition, chaetocin induced the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (p15), E-cadherin (CDH1) and frizzled family receptor 9 (FZD9) through depletion of SUV39H1 and reduced H3K9 methylation in their promoters. Co-treatment with chaetocin and HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) dramatically increased apoptosis and produced greater activation of genes. Furthermore, this combined treatment significantly increased loss of SUV39H1 and reduced histone H3K9 trimethylation responses accompanied by increased acetylation. Importantly, co-treatment with chaetocin and TSA produced potent antileukemic effects in leukemia cells derived from patients.

In Arabidopsis, only two of such enzymes are known to date. One of them, OTLD1, deubiquitylates histone 2B and functions as a transcriptional repressor. But, could the same deubiquitinase act both as a repressor and an activator? Here, we addressed this question. Using gain-of-function and loss-of-function Arabidopsis alleles, we showed that OTLD1 can promote expression of a target gene. This transcriptional activation activity of OTLD1 involves occupation of the target chromatin by this enzyme, deubiquitination of monoubiquitylated H2B within the occupied regions, and formation of the euchromatic histone acetylation and methylation marks. Thus, OTLD1 can play a dual role in transcriptional repression and activation of its target genes. In these reactions, H2B ubiquitylation acts as both a repressive and an active mark whereas OTLD1 association with and deubiquitylation of the target chromatin may represent the key juncture between two opposing effects of this enzyme on gene expression."],"author_name":["Keren I","Citovsky V"],"author_slug":["keren-i/13486162","citovsky-v/11290005"],"citation_count":[0],"doi":["10.1080/15592294.2017.1348446"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592294.2017.1348446"],"id":[62785864],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Epigenetics"],"keywords":["Chromatin, chromatin remodeling, epigenetics, histone modifications"],"pub_date":["2017-07-14"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Journal Article"],"slug":["62785864-activation-of-gene-expression-by-histone-deubiquitinase-otld1"],"title":["Activation of gene expression by histone deubiquitinase OTLD1."]},"id":409439},{"score":24.960648,"doc":{"abstract":["Global histone hyperacetylation is suggested to play a critical role for replacement of histones by transition proteins and protamines to compact the genome during spermiogenesis.

Epigenetic marks have pivotal roles in the maintenance of gene expression status, as occurs with methylation on lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me) for Hox gene regulation. In contrast, because the levels of histone acetylation decrease during the mitotic phase, acetylated histone has not been believed to contribute to the maintenance of cell fates. Because members of the bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) family bind to acetylated histones localized on mitotic chromosomes, it is possible that they may regulate the transcriptional status of genes throughout the cell cycle. In this commentary, we discuss the recent analyses of C. elegans BET family protein BET-1, which contributes to the maintenance of cell fates through the histone H2A variant HTZ-1/H2A.z. This mechanism represses transcription of selector genes in the genomic region where lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) is demethylated by histone demethylase UTX-1.

Histone crotonylation was studied in cultured murine proximal tubular cells and in kidneys from mice with AKI induced by folic acid or cisplatin. Histone lysine crotonylation was observed in tubular cells from healthy murine and human kidney tissue. Kidney tissue histone crotonylation increased during AKI. This was reproduced by exposure to the protein TWEAK in cultured tubular cells. Specifically, ChIP-seq revealed enrichment of histone crotonylation at the genes encoding the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator PGC-1α and the sirtuin-3 decrotonylase in both TWEAK-stimulated tubular cells and in AKI kidney tissue. To assess the role of crotonylation in kidney injury, crotonate was used to increase histone crotonylation in cultured tubular cells or in the kidneys in vivo. Crotonate increased the expression of PGC-1α and sirtuin-3, and decreased CCL2 expression in cultured tubular cells and healthy kidneys. Systemic crotonate administration protected from experimental AKI, preventing the decrease in renal function and in kidney PGC-1α and sirtuin-3 levels as well as the increase in CCL2 expression. For the first time, we have identified factors such as cell stress and crotonate availability that increase histone crotonylation in vivo. Overall, increasing histone crotonylation might have a beneficial effect on AKI.

These changes are not only critical for generating diversity of cell types during mammalian development, but are also important for maintaining the stability and integrity of the expression profiles of different cell types. Until recently, the study of human disease has focused on genetic mechanisms rather than on non-coding events. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that altered patterns of histone modifications can lead to several major pathologies. This review focuses on histone acetylation and its role in inflammatory gene expression. Interestingly, the expression and activity of enzymes that regulate this modification have been reported to be abnormal in the airways of patients with respiratory disease. Histone modifications, despite being heritable and stably maintained, are also potentially reversible and there is scope for the development of “epigenetic therapies” for disease."],"author_name":["K-Y Lee"," Lee KY","I.M.

Specific patterns of histone acetylation are found to alter the rate of chromatin remodelling in different ways. For example, histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation acts to increase recruitment of the RSC complex to nucleosomes. However, histone H4 tetra-acetylation alters the spectrum of remodelled products generated by increasing octamer transfer in trans. In contrast, histone H4 tetra-acetylation was also found to reduce the activity of the Chd1 and Isw2 remodelling enzymes by reducing catalytic turnover without affecting recruitment.

The HFM represents a helix-strand-helix motif having three alpha helices connected by two loops/beta strands. This helix-strand-helix motif has the unique property of binding strongly with proteins as well as with DNA. Apart from core histones, the HFM has been reported in a variety of other proteins in all forms of life. In this work, we review the various classes of proteins that contain the HFM, as well as the diverse roles played by these proteins in the plant kingdom. As will be clear from this review, formation of the core histones through multi-merisation is not the only role played by this conserved fold, although the characteristic ability of the HFM to dimerize with suitable partner proteins has been used by nature to perform several non-core-histone functions. Most of the information about plant HFM containing proteins, such as identification and classification, has been done based on homology with yeast and animal counterparts. However, the ability of plants genomes to duplicate extensively has led to the existence of large gene families of the HFM containing proteins, unlike other eukaryotes. Plant HFM containing proteins can broadly be classified under the following major categories; TBP-associated factors (TAF), Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y), Dr1/DrAp1 proteins and the chromatin accessibility complex (CHRAC). These proteins families are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation, co-activation and chromosome maintenance.

In these studies we pursued the hypothesis that TBI pain sensitization is associated with histone acetylation in the rat lateral fluid percussion model. Some animals received hindpaw incisions in addition to TBI to mimic polytrauma. Neuropathological analysis of brain tissue from sham and TBI animals revealed evidence of bleeding, breakdown of the blood brain barrier, in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and other structures related to pain signal processing. Mechanical allodynia was measured in these animals for up to eight weeks post-injury. Inhibitors of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) were used to probe the role of histone acetylation in such pain processing. We followed serum markers including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuron-specific enolase 2 (NSE) myelin basic protein (MBP) and S100β to gauge TBI injury severity. Our results showed that TBI caused mechanical allodynia in the hindpaws of the rats lasting several weeks. Hindpaws contralateral to TBI showed more rapid and profound sensitization than ipsilateral hindpaws. The inhibition of HAT using curcumin 50 mg/kg s.c reduced mechanical sensitization while the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid 50 mg/kg i.p. prolonged sensitization in the TBI rats.

The posttranslational modification of the core histones and the action of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes represent two primary mechanisms by which chromatin dynamics are controlled and linked to nuclear events. Although there are examples in which a histone modification or a remodeling enzyme may be sufficient to drive a chromatin transition, these mechanisms typically work in concert to integrate regulatory inputs, leading to a coordinated alteration in chromatin structure and function. Indeed, site-specific histone modifications can facilitate the recruitment of chromatin remodeling enzymes to particular genomic regions, or they can regulate the efficiency or the outcome of a chromatin remodeling reaction. Conversely, chromatin remodeling enzymes can also influence, and sometimes directly modulate, the modification state of histones. These functional interactions are generally complex, frequently transient, and often require the association of myriad additional factors.

IRF1-overexpressing D54MG cells were associated with significantly increased H4K5, H4K8, and H4K12 acetylation compared to vector-control D54MG cells both globally and at specific target genes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using D54MG cells revealed IRF1 protein-protein interactions with PCAF, P300, CBP, GCN5, ATF2, and HDAC3. ChIP experiments demonstrated increased p300 recruitment to known IRF1 targets in D54MG cells overexpressing IRF1. In contrast, p300 binding to IRF1 targets decreased in D54MG cells with IRF1 knockdown. SLE appears to be associated with an imbalance in histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase enzymes favoring pathologic H4 acetylation. Furthermore, IRF1 directly interacts with chromatin modifying enzymes, supporting a model where recruitment to specific target genes is mediated in part by IRF1."],"author_name":["Sullivan KE"," Zhang Z","Kelly Maurer"," Song L","Zhe Zhang","Maurer K","Li Song","LIHUA SHI"," Shi L","Kathleen E.

Lifestyle and diet can significantly influence epigenetic mechanisms, which cause heritable changes in gene expression without changes in DNA sequence. Nutrient-dependent epigenetic variations can significantly affect genome stability, mRNA and protein expression, and metabolic changes, which in turn influence food absorption and the activity of its constituents. Dietary bioactive compounds can affect epigenetic alterations, which are accumulated over time and are shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Histone acetylation is an epigenetic modification mediated by histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) critically involved in regulating affinity binding between the histones and DNA backbone. The HDAC-mediated increase in histone affinity to DNA causes DNA condensation, preventing transcription, whereas HAT-acetylated chromatin is transcriptionally active. HDAC and HAT activities are reported to be associated with signal transduction, cell growth and death, as well as with the pathogenesis of various diseases. The aim of this review was to evaluate the role of diet and dietary bioactive compounds on the regulation of HATs and HDACs in epigenetic diseases. Dietary bioactive compounds such as genistein, phenylisothiocyanate, curcumin, resveratrol, indole-3-carbinol, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate can regulate HDAC and HAT activities and acetylation of histones and non-histone chromatin proteins, and their health benefits are thought to be attributed to these epigenetic mechanisms. The intake of dietary compounds that regulate epigenetic modifications can provide significant health effects and may prevent various pathological processes involved in the development of cancer and other life-threatening diseases.

SAHA is a potentially new therapeutic approach to cancer treatment and is in Phase I clinical trials. In several tumor cell lines examined, HDAC inhibitors alter the expression of less than 1% of expressed genes, including the cell cycle kinase inhibitor p21WAF1. In T24 bladder carcinoma cells, SAHA induces up to a 9-fold increase in p21WAF1 mRNA and protein, which is, at least in part, because of an increase in the rate of transcription of the gene. SAHA causes an accumulation of acetylated histones H3 and H4 in total cellular chromatin by 2 h, which is maintained through 24 h of culture. An increase in the accumulation of acetylated H3 and H4 was detected throughout the p21WAF1 promoter and the structural gene after culture with SAHA. The level of histone acetylation did not change in chromatin associated with the actin and p27 genes, and their mRNA expression was not altered during culture of T24 cells with SAHA. Thus, the present findings indicate that the induction of p21WAF1 by SAHA is regulated, at least in part, by the degree of acetylation of the gene-associated histones and that this induced increase in acetylation is gene selective."],"author_name":["Sandhoff TW","T.

The prototypical example of histone ubiquitylation is that of histone H2B in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this case, attachment of ubiquitin to lysine 123 (K123) of H2B is important for regulation of both active and transcriptionally silent genes and participates in trans to signal methylation of histone H3. It is generally assumed that H2B is monoubiquitylated at K123 and that it is this single ubiquitin moiety that influences H2B function. To determine whether this assumption is correct, we have re-examined the ubiquitylation status of endogenous H2B in yeast. We find that, contrary to expectations, H2B is extensively polyubiquitylated. Polyubiquitylation of H2B appears to occur within the context of chromatin and is not associated with H2B destruction. There are at least two distinct modes of H2B polyubiquitylation: one that occurs at K123 and depends on the Rad6-Bre1 ubiquitylation machinery and another that occurs on multiple lysine residues and is catalyzed by an uncharacterized ubiquitin ligase(s). Interestingly, these ubiquitylation events are under the influence of different combinations of ubiquitin-specific proteases, suggesting that they have distinct biological functions. These results raise the possibility that some of the biological effects of ubiquitylation of H2B are exerted via ubiquitin chains, rather than a single ubiquitin group."],"author_name":["Fuqiang Geng","William P.

Asf1 is known to directly bind histone H3, however, high-resolution structural information about the geometry of this interaction was previously unknown. Here we report the structure of a histone/histone chaperone interaction. We have solved the 2.2 Å crystal structure of the conserved N-terminal immunoglobulin fold domain of yeast Asf1 (residues 2–155) bound to the C-terminal helix of yeast histone H3 (residues 121–134). The structure defines a histone-binding patch on Asf1 consisting of both conserved and yeast-specific residues; mutation of these residues abrogates H3/H4 binding affinity. The geometry of the interaction indicates that Asf1 binds to histones H3/H4 in a manner that likely blocks sterically the H3/H3 interface of the nucleosomal four-helix bundle. These data clarify how Asf1 regulates histone stoichiometry to modulate epigenetic inheritance.

Cell identity itself is determined by distinct sets of genes that are expressed at a given time. On the level of the individual gene, there is a strong correlation between transcriptional activity and associated histone modifications. Histone modifications act by influencing the recruitment of non‐histone proteins and by determining the level of chromatin compaction, transcription factor binding, and transcription elongation. Accumulating evidence also shows that the subnuclear position of a gene or domain correlates with its expression status. Thus, the question arises whether this spatial organization results from or determines a gene's chromatin status. Although the association of a promoter with the inner nuclear membrane (INM) is neither necessary nor sufficient for repression, the perinuclear sequestration of heterochromatin is nonetheless conserved from yeast to man. How does subnuclear localization influence gene expression? Recent work argues that the common denominator between genome organization and gene expression is the modification of histones and in some cases of histone variants. This provides an important link between local chromatin structure and long‐range genome organization in interphase cells. In this review, we will evaluate how histones contribute to the latter, and discuss how this might help to regulate genes crucial for cell differentiation."],"author_name":["Harr JC","Adriana Gonzalez‐Sandoval","Gonzalez-Sandoval A","Jennifer C.

The technique was used to study histone H3 Ser10 (H3S10) phosphorylation, which occurs during chromosome condensation in mitosis mediated by the aurora B kinase. In aneuploid cancer cells that frequently missegregate chromosomes, H3S10 is phosphorylated just before the chromosomes condense, whereas aurora B already accumulates in nuclei during S phase. In contrast, in nontransformed cells, phosphorylated H3S10 foci appear for a few hours during interphase, and transient exposure to an aurora B-selective inhibitor during this period induces chromosome missegregation. These results suggest that, during interphase, moderate aurora B activity or H3S10 phosphorylation is required for accurate chromosome segregation. Visualizing histone modifications in living cells will facilitate future epigenetic and cell regulation studies."],"author_name":["Naohito Nozaki","Y.

Glycation reaction was carried out by incubating H2A histone with 10 mM deoxyribose for 21 days at 37 °C. Structural changes in glycated-H2A were studied by various physico-chemical techniques. The antigen-antibody interaction was studied by direct binding, inhibition ELISA and mobility shift assay. Deoxyribose-modified-H2A histone showed increased hyperchromicity and increased fluorescence intensity. CD results demonstrated almost 50% loss in alpha helix conformation as a consequence of glycation. This was supported by an increase in Tm value vis-à-vis thermal stability. Glycated-H2A showed cross linking in SDS-PAGE. SLE sera positive for anti-nDNA autoantibodies showed preference for deoxyribose-modified-H2A histone compared to native H2A histone or native DNA.

Deoxyribose-modified-H2A histone exhibited damage as revealed by various physico-chemical studies. Glycation of H2A has resulted in the generation of neo-epitopes on H2A histone, which are preferably bound by SLE anti-nDNA autoantibodies.

Many of the PHDs studied to date bind to unmodified or methylated states of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). Additionally, many of these domains, and the proteins they are contained in, have crucial roles in the regulation of gene expression and cancer development. Despite this, the majority of PHD fingers have gone uncharacterized; thus, our understanding of how these domains contribute to chromatin biology remains incomplete. Results We expressed and screened 123 of the annotated human PHD fingers for their histone binding preferences using reader domain microarrays. A subset (31) of these domains showed strong preference for the H3 N-terminal tail either unmodified or methylated at H3K4. These H3 readers were further characterized by histone peptide microarrays and/or AlphaScreen to comprehensively define their H3 preferences and PTM cross-talk. Conclusions The high-throughput approaches utilized in this study establish a compendium of binding information for the PHD reader family with regard to how they engage histone PTMs and uncover several novel reader domain–histone PTM interactions (i.e., PHRF1 and TRIM66). This study highlights the usefulness of high-throughput analyses of histone reader proteins as a means of understanding how chromatin engagement occurs biochemically."],"author_name":["CariSagum ","MarkT.Bedford ","Jonathan M.

However, this paradigm does not apply to transcriptional activation of all genes. In this study we have characterized a group of genes that are repressed by histone acetylation. These histone hypoacetylation-activated genes (HHAAG) are normally repressed during exponential growth, when the cellular level of acetyl-CoA is high and global histone acetylation is also high. The HHAAG are induced during diauxic shift, when the levels of acetyl-CoA and global histone acetylation decrease. The histone hypoacetylation-induced activation of HHAAG is independent of Msn2/Msn4. The repression of HSP12, one of the HHAAG, is associated with well-defined nucleosomal structure in the promoter region, while histone hypoacetylation-induced activation correlates with delocalization of positioned nucleosomes or with reduced nucleosome occupancy.

Taken together, these results suggest a model in which histone acetylation is required for proper positioning of promoter nucleosomes and repression of HHAAG.

There are approximately 60 known human bromodomains, which are divided into eight sub‐families based on structural conservation. The bromodomain‐containing proteins in family IV include seven members (BRPF1, BRPF2, BRPF3, BRD7, BRD9, ATAD2, and ATAD2b). The bromodomains of each of these proteins recognize and bind acetyllysine residues on histone tails protruding from the nucleosome. However, the histone marks recognized by each bromodomain protein can be very different. The BRPF1 subunit of the MOZ histone acetyltransferase (HAT) recognizes acetylated histones H2AK5ac, H4K12ac, H3K14ac, H4K8ac, and H4K5ac. While the bromodomain of BRD7, a member of the SWI/SNF complex, was shown to preferentially recognize acetylated histones H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4K8ac, H4K12ac, and H4K16ac. The bromodomains of BRPF2 and BRPF3 have similar sequences, and function as part of the HBO1 HAT complex, but there is limited data on which histone ligands they bind. Similarly, there is little known about the histone targets of the BRD9 and ATAD2b bromodomain proteins. Interestingly, the ATAD2 bromodomain was recently shown to preferentially bind to the di‐acetylated H4K5acK12ac mark found in newly synthesized histones following DNA replication. However, despite the physiological importance of the family IV bromodomains, little is known about how they function at the molecular or atomic level. In this review, we summarize our understanding of how family IV bromodomains recognize and select for acetyllysine marks and discuss the importance of acetylated histone recognition for their biological functions.

Here, we show that KDM5A is physically and functionally associated with two histone deacetylase complexes. Immunoaffinity purification of KDM5A confirmed a previously described association with the SIN3B-containing histone deacetylase complex and revealed an association with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Sucrose density gradient and sequential immunoprecipitation analyses further confirmed the stable association of KDM5A with these two histone deacetylase complexes. KDM5A depletion led to changes in the expression of hundreds of genes, two-thirds of which were also controlled by CHD4, the NuRD catalytic subunit. Gene ontology analysis confirmed that the genes commonly regulated by both KDM5A and CHD4 were categorized as developmentally regulated genes. ChIP analyses suggested that CHD4 modulates H3K4 methylation levels at the promoter and coding regions of target genes. We further demonstrated that the Caenorhabditis elegans homologues of KDM5 and CHD4 function in the same pathway during vulva development. These results suggest that KDM5A and the NuRD complex cooperatively function to control developmentally regulated genes.

Many of these PTMs are produced through cellular metabolism to offer both feedback and feedforward regulation. Herein we describe the existence of Lys and Arg modifications on histones by a glycolytic by-product, methylglyoxal (MGO). Our data demonstrate that adduction of histones by MGO is an abundant modification, present at the same order of magnitude as Arg methylation. These modifications were detected on all four core histones at critical residues involved in both nucleosome stability and reader domain binding. In addition, MGO treatment of cells lacking the major detoxifying enzyme, glyoxalase 1, results in marked disruption of H2B acetylation and ubiquitylation without affecting H2A, H3, and H4 modifications. Using RNA sequencing, we show that MGO is capable of altering gene transcription, most notably in cells lacking GLO1. Finally, we show that the deglycase DJ-1 protects histones from adduction by MGO.

Cleavage of the DNA with either DNase I or micrococcal nuclease to fragments of an average size of 10-20 kilobases (kb) dramatically induces the formation of poly(ADP-ribosylated) species of histones in nuclei. As the number of DNA strand breaks produced by either DNase I or micrococcal nuclease increases and a great number of DNA cuts is introduced (fragments of 0.4-0.2 kb), the size of the poly(ADP-ribose) chains on the histones decreases. Finally, in the presence of 10 mM cAMP as an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, human lymphoid nuclei synthesize hyper(ADP-ribosylated) histone H2B with at least 40 ADP-ribose groups attached to it. Lateral ladders emanating at precise points of the linear ladder on hypermodified H2B can arise from branching of poly(ADP-ribose) or from multiple monomodifications of glutamic (or aspartic) acid residues.

To quantify changes in histone acetylation, we developed an unbiased quantitative mass spectrometry analysis on affinity-purified acetylated histone peptides, generated by differential parallel proteolysis. We identify a large number of histone acetylation sites and observe an overall reduction of acetylated histone residues in response to DNA damage, indicative of a histone-wide loss of acetyl modifications. This decrease is mainly caused by DNA damage-induced replication stress coupled to specific proteasome-dependent loss of acetylated histones. Strikingly, this degradation of acetylated histones is independent of ubiquitylation but requires the PA200-proteasome activator, a complex that specifically targets acetylated histones for degradation. The uncovered replication stress-induced degradation of acetylated histones represents an important chromatin-modifying response to cope with replication stress."],"author_name":["Demmers JA","Janssens RC","Bezstarosti K","Geijer ME","Rijkers E","Hoeijmakers JH","Kik I","Marteijn JA","Raams A","Mandemaker IK","Vermeulen W","Lans H"],"author_slug":["demmers-ja/13383370","janssens-rc/13593004","bezstarosti-k/11499734","geijer-me/31783844","rijkers-e/14732770","hoeijmakers-jh/11386997","kik-i/31891590","marteijn-ja/13831432","raams-a/13677185","mandemaker-ik/14064907","vermeulen-w/11621387","lans-h/13698046"],"citation_count":[0],"doi":["10.15252/embr.201745566"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.15252/embr.201745566"],"id":[63532134],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["EMBO reports"],"keywords":["DNA damage, PA200‐proteasome, acetylation, histone, replication stress"],"pub_date":["2018-08-15"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Journal Article"],"slug":["63532134-dna-damage-induced-replication-stress-results-in-pa200-proteasome-mediated-degradation-of-acetylated-histones"],"title":["DNA damage-induced replication stress results in PA200-proteasome-mediated degradation of acetylated histones."]},"id":651250},{"score":24.58764,"doc":{"abstract":["Chromatin decondensation is a key mechanism that guarantees gene transcription and repair of the genome, regulated mainly by the acetylation of histones.

Cancer is the principal example among such maladies. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the genesis and progression of cancer, its epigenetic regulation, particularly histone deacetylation, demands further studies. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are one of the key players in the gene expression regulation network in cancer because of their repressive role on tumor suppressor genes. Higher expression and function of deacetylases disrupt the finely tuned acetylation homeostasis in both histone and non-histone target proteins. This brings about alterations in the genes implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and other cellular processes. Moreover, the reversible nature of epigenetic modulation by HDACs makes them attractive targets for cancer remedy. This review summarizes the current knowledge of HDACs in tumorigenesis and tumor progression as well as their contribution to the hallmarks of cancer. The present report also describes briefly various assays to detect histone deacetylase activity and discusses the potential role of histone deacetylase inhibitors as emerging epigenetic drugs to cure cancer.

Histone chaperones are significant players in chromatin organization. They play a significant role in vital nuclear functions like transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair, DNA recombination, and epigenetic regulation, primarily by aiding processes such as histone shuttling and nucleosome assembly/disassembly. Like the other eukaryotes, plants also have a highly orchestrated and dynamic chromatin organization. Plants seem to have more isoforms within the same family of histone chaperones, as compared with other organisms. As some of these are specific to plants, they must have evolved to perform functions unique to plants. However, it appears that only little effort has gone into understanding the structural features of plant histone chaperones and their structure-function relationships. Studies on plant histone chaperones are essential for understanding their role in plant chromatin organization and how plants respond during stress conditions. This review is on the structural and functional aspects of plant histone chaperone families, specifically those which bind to H2A-H2B, viz nucleosome assembly protein (NAP), nucleoplasmin (NPM), and facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT).

In this study, we investigate the role of the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 during spermatogenesis and find that RNF8-deficient mice are proficient in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) but deficient in global nucleosome removal. Moreover, we show that RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitination induces H4K16 acetylation, which may be an initial step in nucleosome removal.

Here we report that exposure of human hepatoma cells to Cur led to a significant decrease of histone acetylation. Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) are the enzymes controlling the state of histone acetylation in vivo. Cur treatment resulted in a comparable inhibition of histone acetylation in the absence or presence of trichostatin A (the specific HDAC inhibitor), and showed no effect on the in vitro activity of HDAC. In contrast, the domain negative of p300 (a most potent HAT protein) could block the inhibition of Cur on histone acetylation; and the Cur treatment significantly inhibited the HAT activity both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, it is HAT, but not HDAC that is involved in Cur-induced histone hypoacetylation. At the same time, exposure of cells to low or high concentrations of Cur diminished or enhanced the ROS generation, respectively. And the promotion of ROS was obviously involved in Cur-induced histone hypoacetylation, since Cur-caused histone acetylation and HAT activity decrease could be markedly diminished by the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) or their combination, but not by their heat-inactivated forms. The data presented here prove that HAT is one of the in vivo target molecules of Cur; through inhibiting its activity, Cur induces histone hypoacetylation in vivo, where the ROS generation plays an important role.

BROMO domain adjacent to zinc finger 2B (BAZ2B) is a multidomain histone-binding protein that contains two histone reader modules, a plant homeodomain (PHD) and a bromodomain (BRD), linked by a largely disordered linker. Although previous studies have reported specificity of the PHD domain for the unmodified N terminus of histone H3 and of the BRD domain for H3 acetylated at Lys14 (H3K14ac), the exact mode of H3 binding by BAZ2B and its regulation are underexplored. Here, using isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy, we report that acidic residues in the BAZ2B PHD domain are essential for H3 binding and that BAZ2B PHD–BRD establishes a polyvalent interaction with H3K14ac. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the disordered interdomain linker modulates the histone-binding affinity by interacting with the PHD domain. In particular, lysine-rich stretches in the linker, which resemble the positively charged N terminus of histone H3, reduce the binding affinity of the PHD finger toward the histone substrate. Phosphorylation, acetylation, or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the linker residues may therefore act as a cellular mechanism to transiently tune BAZ2B histone-binding affinity. Our findings further support the concept of interdomain linkers serving a dual role in substrate binding by appropriately positioning the adjacent domains and by electrostatically modulating substrate binding.

Mechanistic studies revealed that the expression of transcription factor, inhibitor of DNA-binding protein (ID2), a critical factor for NK cell development, is impaired in Mysm1(-/-) NK cells. MYSM1 interacts with nuclear factor IL-3 (NFIL3, also known as E4BP4), a critical factor for mouse NK cell development, and the recruitment of nuclear factor Il-3 to the ID2 locus is dependent on MYSM1. Further, we observed that MYSM1 is involved in maintaining an active chromatin at the ID2 locus to promote NK cell development.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors block the action of histone deacetylases, leading to inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. This article reviewed the potential therapeutic effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors on uveal melanoma. MEDLINE database was used under the key words/phrases: histone deacetylase, inhibitors, uveal melanoma and targeted therapies for uveal melanoma. A total of 47, English articles, not only referring to uveal melanoma, published up to February 2018 were used. Valproic acid, trichostatin A, tenovin-6, depsipeptide, panobinostat (LBH-589), vorinostat (suberanilohydroxamic acid) entinostat (MS-275), quisinostat, NaB, JSL-1, MC1568 and MC1575 are histone deacetylase inhibitors that have demonstrated promising antitumor effects against uveal melanoma. Histone deacetylase inhibitors represent a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of uveal melanoma."],"author_name":["Garmpi A","Lavaris A","Dettoraki M"," Damaskos C","Tsatsos M","Garmpis N","Androudi S","Kalogeropoulos D","Moschos MM"],"author_slug":["garmpi-a/29468458","lavaris-a/29654986","dettoraki-m/16388126","damaskos-c/8390695","tsatsos-m/14104049","garmpis-n/16338084","androudi-s/13324101","kalogeropoulos-d/12616353","moschos-mm/13481996"],"citation_count":[0],"doi":["10.21873/anticanres.12665"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.12665"],"id":[63458198],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Anticancer research"],"keywords":["Histone, deacetylase, inhibitor, melanoma, review, targeted, therapy, uveal"],"pub_date":["2018-07-05"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Journal Article"],"slug":["63458198-the-role-of-histone-deacetylase-inhibitors-in-uveal-melanoma-current-evidence"],"title":["The Role of Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors in Uveal Melanoma: Current Evidence."]},"id":503048},{"score":24.526222,"doc":{"abstract":["Histone modifications play an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. All histone modifications are reversible, which may therefore provide a flexible way for regulating gene expression during the plant's development and during the plant response to environmental stimuli. The reversible acetylation and deacetylation of specific lysine residues on core histones are catalysed by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDAs). HDA6 is an RPD3-type histone deacetylase in Arabidopsis. The Arabidopsis HDA6 mutant, axe1-5, and HDA6 RNA-interfering plants displayed a phenotype that was hypersensitive to ABA and salt stress. Compared with wild-type plants, the expression of the ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes, ABI1, ABI2, KAT1, KAT2, DREB2A, RD29A, and RD29B, was decreased in axe1-5 and HDA6 RNA-interfering plants when treated with ABA or salt stress. It was found that both ABA and salt stress could enrich the gene activation markers, histone H3K9K14 acetylation, and H3K4 trimethylation, but decrease the gene repression marker, H3K9 dimethylation, of the ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes. Our study indicates that HDA6-involved histone modifications modulate seed germination and the salt stress response, as well as ABA- and salt stress-induced gene expression in Arabidopsis."],"author_name":["Y Y Wang","M Luo","Ming Luo","Wang YY","Chen LT","Yu-Yuan Wang","Keqiang Wu","Li-Ting Chen","Luo M","K Wu","L-T Chen"," Wu K"],"author_slug":["y-y-wang/118253","m-luo/147658","ming-luo/100912","wang-yy/9217486","chen-lt/11237968","yu-yuan-wang/661154","keqiang-wu/458362","li-ting-chen/150140","luo-m/8980235","k-wu/521751","l-t-chen/320563","wu-k/8427694"],"citation_count":[126],"doi":["10.1093/jxb/erq154"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq154"],"id":[246468],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Journal of experimental botany"],"keywords":["arabidopsis,abscisic acid,salt stress,hda6,histone deacetylase,rna interference,histones,sodium chloride,germination,acetylation,"],"pub_date":["2010-01-01"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":[""],"slug":["246468-involvement-of-arabidopsis-histone-deacetylase-hda6-in-aba-and-salt-stress-response"],"title":["Involvement of Arabidopsis histone deacetylase HDA6 in ABA and salt stress response."]},"id":7997254},{"score":24.525517,"doc":{"abstract":["DNA methylation has been implicated in chromatin condensation and nuclear organization, especially at sites of constitutive heterochromatin.

These findings identify new functions for the Paf1 and Bur1-Bur2 complexes, provide evidence that histone modifications at the 5' and 3' ends of coding regions are regulated by distinct mechanisms, and reveal that the Bur1-Bur2 and Paf1 complexes repress cryptic transcription through a Set2-independent pathway."],"author_name":["Arndt KM","Rajna Simic","Simić R","Prelich G","Marcie H.

Not only novel potent and selective histone deacetylase inhibitors to fight specific types of cancer or non-cancerous diseases are presented but also the interesting therapeutic approach to use histone deacetylase inhibitors joint with other epigenetic modulators and / or other chemotherapeutics to combine their therapeutic potential are being discussed."],"author_name":["Giulia Stazi","Clemens Zwergel","Sergio Valente","Antonello Mai"],"author_slug":["giulia-stazi/1268722","clemens-zwergel/1821072","sergio-valente/477845","antonello-mai/477846"],"citation_count":[0],"doi":[""],"html_url":["http://clinical-epigenetics.imedpub.com/histone-deacetylase-inhibitors-updated-studies-in-various-epigeneticrelated-diseases.php?aid=8724"],"id":[8852637],"impact_factor":[""],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Journal of Clinical Epigenetics"],"keywords":["Epigenetics, Histone deacetylases, Inhibitors, Oncology, Inflammation, Neurology, Virology"],"pub_date":["2016-03-14"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Article"],"slug":["8852637-histone-deacetylase-inhibitors-updated-studies-in-various-epigenetic-related-diseases"],"title":["Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors: Updated Studies in Various Epigenetic-Related Diseases"]},"id":7073149},{"score":24.478945,"doc":{"abstract":["Histone acetylation modulates alternative splicing of several hundred genes. Here, we tested the role of the histone acetyltransferase p300 in alternative splicing and showed that knockdown of p300 promotes inclusion of the fibronectin (FN1) alternative EDB exon. p300 associates with CRE sites in the promoter via the CREB transcription factor. We created mini-gene reporters driven by an artificial promoter containing CRE sites. Both deletion and mutation of the CRE site affected EDB alternative splicing in the same manner as p300 knockdown. Next we showed that p300 controls histone H4 acetylation along the FN1 gene. Consistently, p300 depletion and CRE deletion/mutation both reduced histone H4 acetylation on mini-gene reporters. Finally, we provide evidence that the effect of CRE inactivation on H4 acetylation and alternative splicing is counteracted by the inhibition of histone deacetylases. Together, these data suggest that histone acetylation could be one of the mechanisms how promoter and promoter binding proteins influence alternative splicing.

Isochore domains differ in gene expression levels, replication timing, levels of meiotic recombination and chromatin structure. The molecular basis for these differences is poorly understood.We have compared GC- and AT-rich isochores of yeast with respect to chromatin conformation, histone modification status and transcription. Using 3C analysis we show that, along chromosome III, GC-rich isochores have a chromatin structure that is characterized by lower chromatin interaction frequencies compared to AT-rich isochores, which may point to a more extended chromatin conformation. In addition, we find that throughout the genome, GC-rich and AT-rich genes display distinct levels of histone modifications. Interestingly, elimination of the histone deacetylase Rpd3p differentially affects conformation of GC- and AT-rich domains. Further, deletion of RPD3 activates expression of GC-rich genes more strongly than AT-rich genes. Analyses of effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, global patterns of Rpd3p binding and effects of deletion of RPD3 on histone H4 acetylation confirmed that conformation and activity of GC-rich chromatin are more sensitive to Rpd3p-mediated deacetylation than AT-rich chromatin.We find that GC-rich and AT-rich chromatin domains display distinct chromatin conformations and are marked by distinct patterns of histone modifications. We identified the histone deacetylase Rpd3p as an attenuator of these base composition-dependent differences in chromatin status. We propose that GC-rich chromatin domains tend to occur in a more active conformation and that Rpd3p activity represses this propensity throughout the genome."],"author_name":["Job Dekker","Dekker J"],"author_slug":["job-dekker/345365","dekker-j/15183"],"citation_count":[34],"doi":["10.1186/gb-2007-8-6-r116"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2007-8-6-r116"],"id":[131398],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Genome biology"],"keywords":["chromatin structure,histone code,histone modification,gene expression,"],"pub_date":["2007-01-01"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":[""],"slug":["131398-gc-and-at-rich-chromatin-domains-differ-in-conformation-and-histone-modification-status-and-are-differentially-modulated-by-rpd3p"],"title":["GC- and AT-rich chromatin domains differ in conformation and histone modification status and are differentially modulated by Rpd3p."]},"id":7885011},{"score":24.473362,"doc":{"abstract":["Epithelial ovarian cancer has the highest mortality of the gynecological malignancies. High grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (SEOC) is the most common subtype, with the majority of women presenting with advanced disease where 5 year survival is around 25%. Platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with paclitaxel remains the most effective treatment despite platinum therapies being introduced almost 40 years ago. Advances in molecular medicine are underpinning new strategies for the treatment of cancer. Major advances have been made by international initiatives to sequence cancer genomes. For SEOC, with the exception of TP53 that is mutated in virtually 100% of these tumors, there is no other gene mutated at high frequency. There is extensive copy number variation, as well as changes in methylation patterns that will influence gene expression. To date, the role of histones and their post-translational modifications in ovarian cancer is a relatively understudied field. Post-translational histone modifications play major roles in gene expression as they direct the configuration of chromatin and so access by transcription factors. Histone modifications include methylation, acetylation and monoubiquitination, with involvement of enzymes including histone methyl transferases (HMTases), histone acetyltransferases/deacetylases and ubiquitin ligases/deubiquitinases respectively. Complexes such as the Polycomb Repressive Complex also play roles in the control of histone modifications and more recently roles for long non-coding (lnc) RNA and microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging. Epigenomic-based therapies targeting histone modifications are being developed and offer new approaches for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

Histone mRNAs are rapidly degraded when DNA synthesis is inhibited in S phase in mammalian cells. Rapid degradation of histone mRNAs is initiated by oligouridylation of the 3' end of histone mRNAs and requires the cytoplasmic Lsm1-7 complex, which can bind to the oligo(U) tail. An exonuclease, 3'hExo, forms a ternary complex with SLBP and the stem-loop and is required for the initiation of histone mRNA degradation. The Lsm1-7 complex is also involved in degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs. It binds to the oligo(A) tail remaining after deadenylation, inhibiting translation and recruiting the enzymes required for decapping. Whether the Lsm1-7 complex interacts directly with other components of the mRNP is not known. We report here that the C-terminal extension of Lsm4 interacts directly with the histone mRNP, contacting both SLBP and 3'hExo.

A typical fission yeast gene shows a distinct peak of histone acetylation around the ATG and gradually decreased acetylation levels in the coding region. The patterns are independent of gene length but dependent on the gene expression levels. H3K9Ac shows a stronger peak near the ATG and is more reduced in the coding regions of genes with high expression compared with genes with low expression levels.

In the present study, to understand the mechanism regulating the changes in gene expression, diverse histone modifications in blastocysts were studied using a delayed implantation model, in which embryos were kept in a dormant state in the uterus by maternal ovariectomy and progesterone treatment, and then activated by injection with estrogen. Total transcriptional activity increased markedly in activated embryos, and immunocytochemistry with antibodies recognizing specific histone modifications revealed differential modification of several histones in the trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass (ICM) of dormant and activated embryos. High levels of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) dimethylation, which suppresses gene expression, were observed in the ICM, but not in the TE, of dormant embryos, and the levels decreased when the embryos were activated, consistent with changes in transcriptional activity. Substitution of histone H3.3, a variant of H3, for dominant H3.1 increased in activated embryos, suggesting that histone substitution is involved in inducing gene expression associated with activation. In the nucleus, H3.3 was mainly localized in the nucleoli of activated embryos but not in those of dormant ones. In contrast, there were no obvious differences in the trimethylation of histone H3K9 or the acetylation of histones H3K9, H3K18 and H4K12 between dormant and activated embryos. These results suggest that a decrease in H3K9 dimethylation contributes to the acquisition of implantation competence by releasing genes from suppression. In addition, histone H3.3 substitution seems to be involved in global gene activation and facilitates the prompt recovery of dormant blastocysts to the active state by inducing rRNA synthesis, resulting in an increase in translational activity."],"author_name":["Fugaku Aoki","Tomohiko Akiyama","Senkiti Sakai","Tamako Matsuhashi"],"author_slug":["fugaku-aoki/263286","tomohiko-akiyama/944430","senkiti-sakai/6335813","tamako-matsuhashi/864103"],"citation_count":[0],"doi":["10.1111/j.1740-0929.2007.00478.x"],"html_url":["https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2007.00478.x"],"id":[6884335],"impact_factor":["1.402"],"impact_factor_int":[1],"journal":["Animal Science Journal"],"keywords":["acetylation, dormant embryo, H3.3, histone, methylation"],"pub_date":["2007-12-01"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Article"],"slug":["6884335-changes-in-histone-modification-upon-activation-of-dormant-mouse-blastocysts"],"title":["Changes in histone modification upon activation of dormant mouse blastocysts"]},"id":1145456},{"score":24.421783,"doc":{"abstract":["Epigenetics is defined as heritable changes to the transcriptome that are independent of changes in the genome.

Here we show that Plc1p is required for a normal level of histone acetylation; plc1Δ cells that do not synthesize any InsPs display decreased acetylation of bulk histones and global hypoacetylation of chromatin histones. In accordance with the role of Plc1p in supporting histone acetylation, plc1Δ mutation is synthetically lethal with mutations in several subunits of SAGA and NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes. Conversely, the growth rate, sensitivity to multiple stresses, and the transcriptional defects of plc1Δ cells are partially suppressed by deletion of histone deacetylase HDA1. The histone hypoacetylation in plc1Δ cells is due to the defect in degradation of repressor Mth1p, and consequently lower expression of HXT genes and reduced conversion of glucose to acetyl-CoA, a substrate for HATs. The histone acetylation and transcriptional defects can be partially suppressed and the overall fitness improved in plc1Δ cells by increasing the cellular concentration of acetyl-CoA. Together, our data indicate that Plc1p and InsPs are required for normal acetyl-CoA homeostasis, which, in turn, regulates global histone acetylation.

Acetylation-mediated histone/non-histone protein modification plays an important role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Histone modification is controlled by the balance between histone acetyltransferase and (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes. Imbalance between the activities of these two enzymes is associated with various forms of cancer. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) regulate the activity of HDACs and are being used in cancer treatment either alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs/radiotherapy.

Several other HDACi of natural and synthetic origin are under clinical trial for the evaluation of efficiency and side-effects. Natural compounds of plant, fungus, and actinomycetes origin, such as phenolics, polyketides, tetrapeptide, terpenoids, alkaloids, and hydoxamic acid, have been reported to show potential HDAC-inhibitory activity. Several HDACi of natural and dietary origin are butein, protocatechuic aldehyde, kaempferol (grapes, green tea, tomatoes, potatoes, and onions), resveratrol (grapes, red wine, blueberries and peanuts), sinapinic acid (wine and vinegar), diallyl disulfide (garlic), and zerumbone (ginger). HDACi exhibit their antitumor effect by the activation of cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and autophagy, angiogenesis inhibition, increased reactive oxygen species generation causing oxidative stress, and mitotic cell death in cancer cells.

HPV PsVs have been designed to form capsids made up of the major capsid protein L1 and the minor capsid proteins L2. HPV PsVs have been produced in 293TT cells transfected with plasmid expressing L1 and L2 protein and plasmid containing the reporter gene. Several studies have suggested that naturally occurring HPV virions contain cellular histones, and histones have also been identified in mature HPV PsVs. However, the effect of the histones on the properties of the PsVs has not been investigated. Using heparin chromatography, we separated mature HPV type 16 PsVs into three fractions (I, II, and III) according to their heparin-binding affinities.<h3>Results</h3>The amounts of cellular histone and cellular nucleotides per PsV were found to increase in the order fraction I, II and III. It appeared that PsVs in fraction I contains just small amount of cellular histone in Western blot analysis. The proportions of the three fractions in PsV preparations were 83.4, 7.5, and 9.1 % for fraction I, II, and III PsVs, respectively. In the electron microscope PsVs in fraction I appeared to have a more condensed structure than those in fractions II and III. Under the electron microscope fraction II and III PsVs appeared to be covered by substantial amounts of cellular histone while there was no visible histone covering PsVs of fraction I. Also the levels of reporter gene expression in infections of fraction II and III PsVs to 293TT cells were significantly lower than those in infections of fraction I PsV, and fraction II and III particles had significantly reduced immunogenicity.<h3>Conclusions</h3>Our findings suggest that the involvement of large amounts of cellular histones during PsV formation interferes with the structural integrity of the PsVs and affects their immunogenicity. The fraction I particle therefore has the most suitable characteristics for use as an HPV PsV.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12896-016-0296-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users."],"author_name":["Hye-Lim Kwag","Kwag HL"," Kim HJ","Hong Jin Kim","Hyoung-Jin Kim"],"author_slug":["hye-lim-kwag/1123724","kwag-hl/13561427","kim-hj/8407489","hong-jin-kim/515223","hyoung-jin-kim/619805"],"citation_count":[2],"doi":["10.1186/s12896-016-0296-3"],"html_url":["https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12896-016-0296-3"],"id":[1352212],"impact_factor":["2.165"],"impact_factor_int":[2],"journal":["BMC Biotechnology"],"keywords":["Human papillomavirus,Pseudovirion,Heparin chromatography,Histone"],"pub_date":["2016-08-27"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Research article"],"slug":["1352212-characterization-of-human-papillomavirus-type-16-pseudovirus-containing-histones"],"title":["Characterization of human papillomavirus type 16 pseudovirus containing histones"]},"id":459142},{"score":24.380508,"doc":{"abstract":["Modification of histone amino terminal tails by acetylation has long been linked to the transcriptional capacity of genes in chromatin and to various aspects of chromatin dynamics.

Significant insights into the mode of catalysis and histone substrate binding have been provided by the structure determination of the divergent HAT enzymes Hat1, Gcn5/PCAF and Esa1. A comparison of these structures reveals a structurally conserved central core domain that mediates extensive interactions with the acetyl-coenzyme A cofactor, and structurally divergent N and C-terminal domains. A correlation of these structures with other studies reveals that the core domain plays a particularly important role in histone substrate catalysis and that the N and C-terminal domains play important roles in histone substrate binding.

Seizure-induced TLR4/MYD88 signaling plays a critical role in activating microglia and triggering neuron apoptosis. SAHA is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that regulates gene expression by increasing chromatin histone acetylation. In this study, we investigated the role of SAHA in TLR4/MYD88 signaling in a rat seizure model.<h3>Results</h3>Sprague–Dawley rats with kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures were treated with SAHA. The expression of TLR4, MYD88, NF-κB P65 and IL-1β in hippocampus was detected at hour 2 and 6 and day 1, 2, and 3 post seizure. SAHA pretreatment increased seizure latency and decreased seizure scores. The expression levels of TLR4, MYD88, NF-κB and IL-1β increased significantly in both activated microglia and apoptotic neurons after KA treatment. The effects were attenuated by SAHA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the H3 histone acetylation levels significantly decreased while H3K9 levels significantly increased in the KA treatment group. The H3 and H3K9 acetylation levels returned to control levels after SAHA (50 mg/kg) pretreatment. There was a positive correlation between the expression of TLR4 and the acetylation levels of H3K9.<h3>Conclusions</h3>Histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA can suppress seizure-induced TLR4/MYD88 signaling and inhibit TLR4 gene expression through histone acetylation regulation.

The replication-independent histone genes, also known as variants, give rise to distinct mRNAs, whose expression is regulated depending on the growth state of the cell, tissue type and developmental stage. In turn, the histone variants are differentially synthesized and modified by acetylation. Consequently, chromatin structure is altered resulting in complex changes in gene expression. The high conservation among histone protein subtypes suggests that they are indispensable. In addition, conservation of the positions of acetylation within subtypes suggests that the location of these sites is functionally important for the eukaryotic cell. For example, the structures of transcriptionally active and repressed chromatin are different depending on the acetylation state of histone proteins [1-3]. In addition, transcriptionally active and repressed chromatin contains distinct histone variants [4]. Specialized histone variants are targeted to the centromere of the chromosome, where they are essential for chromosome segregation [5]. Other specialized histones exist that are essential for development [6]. Changes in histone acetylation have been implicated in the down-regulation of a tumour suppressor gene in human breast cancer [7]. Acetylation also plays an important role in X chromosome inactivation as well as hormone-mediated transcriptional regulation [8, 9].

In another series, the survival of the histone H3-administered animals was evaluated. Furthermore, the effect of each of the aforementioned anticoagulants on cell death induced by histone H3 was examined in cultured vascular endothelial cells and leukocytes.<h3>Results</h3>Although UFH, LMWH, and argatroban significantly suppressed the histone-induced decrease of the WBC and platelet counts in the animal models of organ dysfunction, only UFH and LMWH attenuated hepatic and renal dysfunction. In addition, the mortality was significantly reduced only by high-dose UFH and LMWH.

The results of the in vitro study further confirmed the above contention and suggested that heparin binds to histones to attenuate the cytotoxic actions of the latter.

Global chromatin states in different cell types are specified by combinatorial effects of post-translational modifications of histones and the expression of histone variants. During mouse spermatogenesis, spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) self-renew while undergo differentiation, events that occur in the company of constant re-modeling of chromatin structures. Previous studies have shown that testes contain highly expressed or specific histone variants to facilitate these epigenetic modifications. However, mechanisms of regulating the epigenetic changes and the specific histone compositions of spermatogenic cells are not fully understood. Using real time quantitative RT-PCR, we examined the dynamic expression of replication-dependent histone genes in post-natal mouse testes. It was found that distinct sets of histone genes are expressed in various spermatogenic cells at different stages during spermatogenesis. While gonocyte-enriched testes from mice at 2-dpp (days post partum) express pre-dominantly thirteen histone variant genes, SSC-stage testes at 9-dpp highly express a different set of eight histone genes. During differentiation stage when testes are occupied mostly by spermatocytes and spermatids, another twenty-two histone genes are expressed much higher than the rest, including previously known testis-specific hist1h1t, hist1h2ba and hist1h4c. In addition, histone genes that are pre-dominantly expressed in gonocytes and SSCs are also highly expressed in embryonic stem cells. Several of them were changed when embryoid bodies were formed from ES cells, suggesting their roles in regulating pluripotency of the cells. Further more, differentially expressed histone genes are specifically localized in either SSCs or spermatocytes and spermatids, as demonstrated by in situ hybridization using gene specific probes. Taken together, results presented here revealed that different combinations of histone variant genes are expressed in distinct spermatogenic cell types accompanying the progression of self-renewal and differentiation of SSCs, suggesting a systematic regulatory role histone variants play during spermatogenesis.

In both interphase and metaphase female cells, using either a myc epitope–tagged or green fluorescent protein–tagged H2A-Bbd construct, the inactive X chromosome is markedly deficient in H2A-Bbd staining, while the active X and the autosomes stain throughout.

Chromatin fractionation demonstrates association of H2A-Bbd with the histone proteins. Separation of micrococcal nuclease–digested chromatin by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation shows cofractionation of H2A-Bbd with nucleosomes, supporting the idea that H2A-Bbd is incorporated into nucleosomes as a substitute for the core histone H2A. This finding, in combination with the overlap with acetylated forms of H4, raises the possibility that H2A-Bbd is enriched in nucleosomes associated with transcriptionally active regions of the genome.

In this study, we investigated the involvement of G9α histone methyltransferase in alcohol‐induced cardiac dysplasia in vivo and in vitro using heart tissues of foetal mice and primary cardiomyocytes of neonatal mice.

The acetylation and methylation status of the histones have been linked with transcriptional regulation of the parasite surface virulence factors as well as other genes with stage specific expression. In P. falciparum as well as other eukaryotes, different histone modifications were found to be compartmentalized to distinct regions in the nuclei. This compartmentalization is believed to be one of the main prerequisites for their function in epigenetic regulation of gene expression.Here we investigate intracellular distributions of five previously uncharacterized histone modifications including histone 4 acetylation on lysine residue 5 (H4K5Ac), H4K8Ac, H3K9Ac, H4Ac4 and H3K9Me1 during the asexual developmental stages. With the exception of H3K9Me1, the modified histones were localized to the nuclear periphery. This provides a strong indication that the P. falciparum nuclear periphery is one of the most active regions in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Interestingly, H3K9Me1 is not associated with the nuclei but instead resides in the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), the double membrane compartments surrounding the parasite cell within the host erythrocyte. In this compartment, H3K9Me1 partially co-localizes with Etramp proteins. The localization of H3K9Me1 in the PV is conserved in the other species including P. yoelii and P. vivax.Similar to other eukaryotes, the periphery of the P. falciparum nuclei is likely one of the most active areas in epigenetic regulation of gene expression involving multiple histone modifications. On the other hand, H3K9Me1 evolved a new function that is linked with the PV.

The observations of the variety, frequency and co-occurrence of histone modifications in distinct patterns at specific genomic loci have led to the idea that hPTMs can create a molecular barcode, read by effector proteins that translate it into a specific transcriptional state, or process, on the underlying DNA. However, despite the fact that this histone-code hypothesis was proposed more than 10 years ago, the molecular details of its working mechanisms are only partially characterized. In particular, two questions deserve specific investigation: how the different modifications associate and synergize into patterns and how these PTM configurations are read and translated by multi-protein complexes into a specific functional outcome on the genome. Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a versatile tool to investigate chromatin biology, useful for both identifying and validating hPTMs, and to dissect the molecular determinants of histone modification readout systems.

In this study, we hypothesized that histone deacetylation at the NIS (SLC5A5) promoter was the mechanism. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation approach, we examined histone acetylation status on the lysine residues H3K9/14, H3K18, total H4, and H4K16 at the NIS promoter under the influence of BRAF V600E. We found that expression of stably or transiently transfected BRAF V600E inhibited NIS expression while the deacetylase inhibitor SAHA stimulated NIS expression in PCCL3 rat thyroid cells. Although BRAF V600E enhanced global histone acetylation, it caused histone deacetylation at the NIS promoter while SAHA caused acetylation in the cells. In human thyroid cancer BCPAP cells harboring homozygous BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF V600E inhibitor, PLX4032, and MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, increased histone acetylation of the NIS promoter, suggesting that BRAF V600E normally maintained histone in a deacetylated state at the NIS promoter. The regions most commonly affected with deacetylation by BRAF V600E were the transcriptionally active areas upstream of the translation start that contained important transcription factor binding sites, including nucleotides -297/-107 in the rat NIS promoter and -692/-370 in the human NIS promoter. Our findings not only reveal an epigenetic mechanism for BRAF V600E-promoted NIS silencing involving histone deacetylation at critical regulatory regions of the NIS promoter but also provide further support for our previously proposed combination therapy targeting major signaling pathways and histone deacetylase to restore thyroid gene expression for radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer.

As a catalytic subunit, MOF can form at least two distinct multiprotein complexes (MSL and NSL) in human cells.

Silencing of MOF in cells leads to genomic instability, inactivation of gene transcription, defective DNA damage repair and early embryonic lethality.

Their scaffolds are formed from chromatin fibers which display an apparent diameter of 15–17 nm and mainly consist from DNA (2 nm) and DNA-associated histones (11 nm). The NET-forming strands are thus not naked DNA but higher ordered chromatin structures. The histones may be released from the NET, especially if their tail arginines have been citrullinated. Several studies indicate that extracellular histones are toxic for mammalian epithelia and endothelia and contribute to the microvascular dysfunction observed e.g., in patients suffering from autoimmune diseases or sepsis. NETs formed at sites of very high neutrophil densities tend to clump and form fairly stable enzymatically active aggregates, referred to as aggNETs. The latter are endowed with a bunch of enzymes that cleave, bind, and/or modify autologous as well as foreign macromolecules.

Here, we identified three cysteine-tryptophan (CW)-domain containing zinc finger (ZF) proteins involved in histone recognition, namely OsCW-ZF3, OsCW-ZF5 and OsCW-ZF7. Protein sequence analysis showed that they have two unknown motifs in addition to the CW domain. All three OsCW-ZFs were expressed in aerial tissues, with relatively high levels in developing panicles. Subcellular localization revealed that the OsCW-ZFs target the cell nucleus and CW domains are not necessary for their nuclear localization. In contrast to OsCW-ZF3 and OsCW-ZF5 where the CW domains bind histone H3 lysine 4 with different methylated forms (H3K4me), the CW domain from OsCW-ZF7 recognizes only trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3). Analysis of mutant suggested that three conserved tryptophan residues in the CW domain are essential for binding to H3K4me. Further study found that OsCW-ZF7 interacts with TAFII20, a transcription initiation factor TFIID 20kDa subunit. Knockout of OsCW-ZF7 caused defective development of awns.

However, the proposed strategies have failed in clinical trials. Although different mechanisms for histone-related cytotoxicity are being explored, those mediated by circulating histones are not fully understood. Extracellular histones induce endothelial cell death, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of complex diseases such as sepsis and septic shock. Therefore, the comprehension of cellular responses triggered by histones is capital to design effective therapeutic strategies. Here we report how extracellular histones induce autophagy and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in cultured human endothelial cells. In addition, we describe how histones regulate these pathways via Sestrin2/AMPK/ULK1-mTOR and AKT/mTOR. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of Toll-like receptors in mediating autophagy and apoptosis demonstrating how TLR inhibitors do not prevent apoptosis and/or autophagy induced by histones. Our results confirm that histones and autophagic pathways can be considered as novel targets to design therapeutic strategies in endothelial damage."],"author_name":["Aguado C","García-López EM","Bueno-Betí C","Garcia-Gimenez JL","Romá-Mateo C","Novella S","Hermenegildo C","Ibañez-Cabellos JS","Pérez-Cremades D","Pallardó FV"],"author_slug":["aguado-c/12107077","garcia-lopez-em/31740294","bueno-beti-c/14933459","garcia-gimenez-jl/13421980","roma-mateo-c/13760680","novella-s/12972746","hermenegildo-c/11119162","ibanez-cabellos-js/16150467","perez-cremades-d/15880035","pallardo-fv/11525763"],"citation_count":[0],"doi":["10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.07.010"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.07.010"],"id":[63275476],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Research on histone methylation has become the most flourishing area of epigenetics in the past fourteen years, and a large amount of data has been accumulated regarding its biology and disease implications. Correspondingly, a lot of efforts have been made to develop small molecule compounds that can specifically modulate histone methyltransferases and methylation reader proteins, aiming for potential therapeutic drugs. Here, we summarize recent progress in chemical probe and drug discovery of histone methyltransferases and methylation reader proteins. For each target, we will review their biological/biochemical functions first, and then focus on their disease implications and drug discovery. We can also see that structure-based compound design and optimization plays a critical role in facilitating the development of highly potent and selective chemical probes and inhibitors for these targets.

Acetylation of core histone N-termini is implicated in the regulation of chromatin function, and I summarize what is known about the mammalian enzymes that promote this posttranslational histone modification. Chromatin is important in gene expression not only because of the accessibility problem that it poses for the transcriptional machinery but also with regard to the phenomenon of chromatin memory, i.e. the ability of alternative chromatin states to be maintained through many cell divisions. This phenomenon is believed to be central to epigenetic inheritance, an important concept in developmental biology, which is also emerging as a contributing factor in cancer and other health disorders. Analyses of the composition of large multiprotein acetyltransferase complexes suggest their role in the mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance.

Materials and methods Studies on cell proliferation were performed with DS19 mouse erythroleukemic cells, PC-3 human prostate cancer cells and Caco-2 human colon cancer cells. Actions on histone deacetylase and the induction of histone acetylation were compared for 4-phenylbutyrate and structurally related molecules. Results Increasing inhibition of cell proliferation by phenyl alkanoic acids together with a decrease in cells in S phase and an increase in apoptotic cells was observed with increased chain length between four and ten carbons. Introduction of double bonds into the side chain was associated with increased growth inhibition. In contrast, 4-phenylbutyrate was a more potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase and inducer of histone acetylation than the other phenyl alkanoic acids examined. Conclusions In comparison with the action of 4-phenylbutyrate, actions other than inhibition of histone deacetylase appear to be more important for growth inhibition by longer chain phenyl alkanoic and phenyl alkenoic acids."],"author_name":["Asif Shareef","Charles desBordes ","Monali Sura","Michael A.

However, the role of autophagy in the development of diabetic retinopathy remains uncertain. Core histone modifications have been reported involved in the development of diabetic retinopathy, but little is known about the histone variants. Here, we observed increased autophagy and histone HIST1H1C/H1.2, an important variant of the linker histone H1, in the retinas of type 1 diabetic rodents. Overexpression of histone HIST1H1C upregulates SIRT1 and HDAC1 to maintain the deacetylation status of H4K16, leads to upregulation of ATG proteins, then promotes autophagy in cultured retinal cell line. Histone HIST1H1C overexpression also promotes inflammation and cell toxicity in vitro. Knockdown of histone HIST1H1C reduces both the basal and stresses (including high glucose)-induced autophagy, and inhibits high glucose induced inflammation and cell toxicity. Importantly, AAV-mediated histone HIST1H1C overexpression in the retinas leads to increased autophagy, inflammation, glial activation and neuron loss, similar to the pathological changes identified in the early stage of diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, knockdown of histone Hist1h1c by siRNA in the retinas of diabetic mice significantly attenuated the diabetes-induced autophagy, inflammation, glial activation and neuron loss. These results indicate that histone HIST1H1C may offer a novel therapeutic target for preventing diabetic retinopathy."],"author_name":["Wang L."," Li J","Wan D"," Wang Q","Zheng L.","Xue W","Liu C.","Sun Y","Wang W","Chen H","Petersen RB"," Huang K"],"author_slug":["wang-l/3285672","li-j/8393580","wan-d/11020176","wang-q/8434339","zheng-l/8585600","xue-w/11513572","liu-c/8599920","sun-y/9876","wang-w/11488","chen-h/18343","petersen-rb/11327652","huang-k/8384016"],"citation_count":[0],"doi":["10.1080/15548627.2017.1293768"],"html_url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15548627.2017.1293768"],"id":[62591458],"impact_factor":["0.0"],"impact_factor_int":[0],"journal":["Autophagy"],"keywords":["H4K16Ac, autophagy, cell toxicity, diabetic retinopathy, histone HIST1H1C, inflammation"],"pub_date":["2017-04-15"],"pub_date_unix":[0],"pub_type":["Journal Article"],"slug":["62591458-histone-hist1h1c-h1-2-regulates-autophagy-in-the-development-of-diabetic-retinopathy"],"title":["Histone HIST1H1C/H1.2 regulates autophagy in the development of diabetic retinopathy."]},"id":227033}],"timings":{"timings":[{"name":"search","duration":22540,"depth":0},{"name":"fetching docs","duration":431298,"depth":0}]}}
